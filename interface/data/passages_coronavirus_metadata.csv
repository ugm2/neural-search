In a small proportion of these, the illness may be severe enough to lead to death⁵. So far the data we have suggest that the risk of severe disease and death increases amongst elderly people and in people with underlying health risk conditions (in the same way as for seasonal flu)⁶ ⁷. Illness is less common and usually less severe in younger adults⁸. Children can be infected⁹ and can have a severe illness¹ᵒ, but based on current data overall illness seems rarer in people under 20 years of age. So far, there has been no obvious sign that pregnant women are more likely to be seriously affected¹¹ ¹².

• minimise the potential impact on society and the UK and global economy, including key public services
• maintain trust and confidence amongst the organisations and people who provide key public services, and those who use them
• ensure dignified treatment of all affected, including those who die
• be active global players - working with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and neighbouring countries, in supporting international efforts to detect the emergence of a pandemic and early assessment of the virus by sharing scientific information
• ensure that the agencies responsible for tackling the outbreak are properly resourced to do so, that they have the people, equipment and medicines they need, and that any necessary changes to legislation are taken forward as quickly as possible

• Contain: detect early cases, follow up close contacts, and prevent the disease taking hold in this country for as long as is reasonably possible
• Delay: slow the spread in this country, if it does take hold, lowering the peak impact and pushing it away from the winter season
• Research: better understand the virus and the actions that will lessen its effect on the UK population; innovate responses including diagnostics, drugs and vaccines; use the evidence to inform the development of the most effective models of care
• Mitigate: provide the best care possible for people who become ill, support hospitals to maintain essential services and ensure ongoing support for people ill in the community to minimise the overall impact of the disease on society, public services and on the economy.

• there will be further publicity of advice to individuals about protecting themselves and others
• treatment and the requirement for medicines and other clinical countermeasures might start to increase, with the need to draw down on existing stockpiles of the most important medicines, medical devices and clinical consumables

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is the lead UK Government Department with responsibility for responding to the risk posed by a future pandemic.

The four UK CMOs provide public health advice to the whole system and government throughout the UK. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) is responsible for ensuring that a single source of coordinated scientific advice is provided to decision makers in COBR.

The NHS works in partnership with Local Resilience Forums on pandemic preparedness and response delivery in healthcare systems in England and Wales. Public Health England provides specialist technical expertise to support both planning and delivery arrangements in England, working closely with public health agencies in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. These organisations have developed plans for coordinating the response at a national level and supporting local responders through their regional structures. The tripartite partnership of DHSC, PHE and NHS England provides strategic oversight and direction for the health and adult social care response to an influenza pandemic, with Department for Education (DfE) leading on the children's social care response. In Devolved Administrations, there are similar arrangements for multi-agency working with strategic oversight provided by the appropriate departments. These arrangements are supported by national co-ordination structures.

PHE and their equivalent in the Devolved Administrations lead the provision of expert advice on health protection issues and actively contributes to the planning and delivery of a multi-agency response. PHE provides health protection services, expertise and advice, delivering specialist public health services to UK national and local government (in England), the NHS/HSCNI and the public, working in partnership to protect the public against infectious diseases. There are comparable public health expert advisory support arrangements in each of the other three UK countries.

NHS England and NHS Improvement and partners have published a series of quick guides to assist multi-agency working and support local health and care systems manage increasing demand on their services. The series of guides can be found at www.nhs.uk/quickguides. Integration Authorities in Scotland have access to a range of government advice on priorities for multi-agency working, which supports existing local plans to optimise care pathways.

Social care is provided by a diverse range of local authority, private and third sector bodies. It is important that the role of social care provision in all sectors is central to contingency planning. Social care providers should remain in contact with local commissioners and resilience partners, review their business continuity plans and continue to practice proper infection control and good respiratory hygiene practice.

Coronaviruses can make humans and animals sick. Some coronaviruses can cause illness similar to the common cold and others can cause more serious diseases, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

151,151,151,151,151,"How is this coronavirus spread?

The coronavirus is most likely to spread from person-to-person through:
• direct close contact with a person while they are infectious
• close contact with a person with a confirmed infection who coughs or sneezes, or
• touching objects or surfaces (such as door handles or tables) contaminated from a cough or sneeze from a person with a confirmed infection, and then touching your mouth or face.
Most infections are only transmitted by people when they have symptoms. These can include fever, a cough, sore throat, tiredness and shortness of breath.

152,152,152,152,152,"How can we help prevent the spread of coronavirus?

Practising good hand and sneeze/cough hygiene is the best defence against most viruses. You should:
• wash your hands frequently with soap and water, before and after eating, and after going to the toilet
• cover your cough and sneeze, dispose of tissues, and use alcohol-based hand sanitiser
• and if unwell, avoid contact with others (stay more than 1.5 metres from people).

Some people who are infected may not get sick at all, some will get mild symptoms from which they will recover easily, and others may become very ill, very quickly. From previous experience with other coronaviruses, the people at most risk of serious infection are:
• people with compromised immune systems (e.g. cancer)
• elderly people
• Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
• people with diagnosed chronic medical conditions
• very young children and babies*
• people in group residential settings
• people in detention facilities.

The patient and the family should be provided with ongoing support and education, and monitoring should continue for the duration of home care. Patients and families should adhere to the following recommendations.

* Place the patient in a well-ventilated single room (i.e., with open windows and an open door).

* Limit the movement of the patient in the house and minimize shared space. Ensure that shared spaces (e.g., kitchen, bathroom) are well ventilated (e.g., keep windows open).

* Household members should stay in a different room or, if that is not possible, maintain a distance of at least 1 m from the ill person (e.g., sleep in a separate bed).³

³ An exception may be made for breastfeeding mothers. Considering the benefits of breastfeeding and the insignificant role of breast milk in the transmission of other respiratory viruses, a mother could can continue breastfeeding. The mother should wear a medical mask when she is near her baby and perform hand hygiene before and after having close contact with the baby. She will also need to follow the other hygiene measures described in this document.

• Limit the number of caregivers. Ideally, assign one person who is in a good health and has no underlying chronic or immunocompromising conditions (3). Visitors should not be allowed until the patient has completely recovered and has no signs and symptoms.

* Perform hand hygiene after any type of contact with patients or their immediate environment (4). Hand hygiene should also be performed before and after preparing food, before eating, after using the toilet and whenever hands look dirty. If hands are not visibly dirty, an alcohol-based hand rub can be used. For visibly dirty hands, use soap and water.

* When washing hands with soap and water, it is preferable to use disposable paper towels to dry hands. If these are not available, use clean cloth towels and replace them when they become wet.

* To contain respiratory secretions, a medical mask⁴ should be provided to the patient and worn as much as possible. Individuals who cannot tolerate a medical mask should use rigorous respiratory hygiene − that is, the mouth and nose should be covered with a disposable paper tissue when coughing or sneezing. Materials used to cover the mouth and nose should be discarded or cleaned appropriately after use (e.g., wash handkerchiefs using regular soap or detergent and water).

* Caregivers should wear a tightly fitted medical mask that covers their mouth and nose when in the same room as the patient. Masks should not be touched or handled during use. If the mask gets wet or dirty from secretions, it must be replaced immediately with a new clean, dry mask. Remove the mask using the appropriate technique – that is, do not touch the front, but instead untie it. Discard the mask immediately after use and perform hand hygiene.

* Avoid direct contact with body fluids, particularly oral or respiratory secretions, and stool. Use disposable gloves and a mask when providing oral or respiratory care and when handling stool, urine and other waste. Perform hand hygiene before and after removing gloves and the mask.

* Do not reuse masks or gloves.

* Use dedicated linen and eating utensils for the patient; these items should be cleaned with soap and water after use and may be re-used instead of being discarded.

* Clean and disinfect daily surfaces that are frequently touched in the room where the patient is being cared for, such as bedside tables, bedframes and other bedroom furniture. Regular household soap or detergent should be used first for cleaning, and then, after rinsing, regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (i.e., equivalent to 5000 pm or 1 part bleach⁵ to 9 parts water) should be applied.

⁴Medical masks are surgical or procedure masks that are flat or pleated (some are shaped like a cup); they are held in place by strings that tie around the back of the head.
⁵ Most household bleach solutions contain 5% sodium hypochlorite. Recommendations on how to calculate the dilution from a given concentration of bleach can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/resource-limited/environmental-cleaning-508.pdf.

* Clean and disinfect bathroom and toilet surfaces at least once daily. Regular household soap or detergent should be used first for cleaning, and then, after rinsing, regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite should be applied.

* Clean the patient’s clothes, bed linen, and bath and hand towels using regular laundry soap and water or machine wash at 60–90 °C with common household detergent, and dry thoroughly. Place contaminated linen into a laundry bag. Do not shake soiled laundry and avoid contaminated materials coming into contact with skin and clothes.

* Gloves and protective clothing (e.g., plastic aprons) should be used when cleaning surfaces or handling clothing or linen soiled with body fluids. Depending on the context, either utility or single-use gloves can be used. After use, utility gloves should be cleaned with soap and water and decontaminated with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution. Single-use gloves (e.g., nitrile or latex) should be discarded after each use. Perform hand hygiene before and after removing gloves.

* Gloves, masks and other waste generated during at-home patient care should be placed into a waste bin with a lid in the patient’s room before being disposed of as infectious waste.⁶

⁶ The local sanitary authority should adopt measures to ensure that the waste is disposed of at a sanitary landfill and not at an unmonitored open dump.

* Avoid other types of exposure to contaminated items from the patient’s immediate environment (e.g., do not share toothbrushes, cigarettes, eating utensils, dishes, drinks, towels, washcloths or bed linen).

* When HCWs provide home care, they should perform a risk assessment to select the appropriate personal protective equipment and follow the recommendations for droplet and contact precautions.

This document provides rapid advice on the use of medical masks in communities, at home and at health care facilities in areas that have reported outbreaks caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It is intended for public health and infection prevention and control (IPC) professionals, health care managers, health care workers and community health workers. It will be revised as more data become available.

With the current information available, it is suggested that the route of human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is either via respiratory droplets or contact. Any person who is in close contact (within 1 meter) with someone who has respiratory symptoms (e.g., sneezing, coughing, etc.) is at risk of being exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets.

Medical masks are surgical or procedure masks that are flat or pleated (some are like cups); they are affixed to the head with strapsᵃ.

Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including 2019-nCoV, in affected areas. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted. If masks are to be used, this measure must be combined with hand hygiene and other IPC measures to prevent the human-tohuman transmission of 2019-nCov. WHO has developed guidance for home careᵇ and health care settingsᶜ on infection prevention and control (IPC) strategies for use when infection with 2019-nCoV is suspected.

There is no higher priority for EPA than protecting the health and safety of Americans. EPA is providing this important information about COVID-19 as it relates to drinking water and wastewater to provide clarity to the public. The COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking-water supplies. Based on current evidence, the risk to water supplies is low. Americans can continue to use and drink water from their tap as usual.

EPA has established regulations with treatment requirements for public water systems that prevent waterborne pathogens such as viruses from contaminating drinking water and wastewater. Coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, is a type of virus that is particularly susceptible to disinfection and standard treatment and disinfectant processes are expected to be effective. EPA is coordinating with our federal partners, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and will continue to provide technical assistance and support, as appropriate.

Medicaid and CHIP play a critical role in helping states and territories respond to public health events, as well as natural and human-made disasters. To assist states and territories in their preparedness efforts, CMS developed a Disaster Preparedness Toolkit that is a longstanding resource that has been available to states and territories on CMS’ website, Medicaid.gov. States and territories are encouraged to be familiar with this resource as part of their emergency preparedness planning. The toolkit outlines numerous strategies available to support Medicaid and CHIP operation s and enrollees in times of crisis, and serves as a comprehensive disaster preparedness resource for states and territories. Many of the flexibilities described in the toolkit will help states and territories in their response to COVID-19. The toolkit is organized by operational areas, such as eligibility and enrollment, benefits, cost-sharing and provider workforce. The toolkit also outlines the legal authorities available to effectuate various strategies, including flexibilities in current statute, Medicaid and CHIP state plan amendments, section 1915(c) waiver Appendix K, and section 1115 demonstrations. The toolkit also describes authority that may be granted through section 1135 waivers, which are only available when the President declares an emergency or natural disaster under the National Emergencies Act or Stafford Act and the Secretary declares a Public Health Emergency Declaration under Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act. The toolkit is available at: https://www.medicaid.gov/state-resource-center/disaster-response-toolkit/index.html.

217,217,217,217,217,"2. How can Appendix K support a state’s response to COVID-19 for 1915(c) Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) Waivers?

CMS developed Appendix K of the section 1915(c) waiver application for use by states during emergencies. It describes actions states can take under existing section 1915(c) HCBS waiver authority to respond to an emergency. The appendix may be approved retroactively, as needed, to the date of the event. A completed Appendix K should be submitted for each affected waiver and should be used to advise CMS of expected changes to state waiver operations. Changes may include establishing a hotline, increasing the number of individuals served under a waiver, creating an emergency person-centered service plan, expanding provider qualifications, increasing the pool of providers who can render services, instituting or expanding opportunities for self-direction, and/or permitting payment to HCBS providers when an individual is in a shortterm hospital or institutional stay.

Appendix K also provides states with opportunities to:

* temporarily increase individual eligibility cost limits,

* modify service, scope, or coverage requirements,

* exceed service limitations,

* add services to the waiver,

* provide services in out-of-state settings, and/or

* permit payment for services rendered by family caregivers or legally responsible individuals.

A state or territory may not include changes in Appendix K that are not permitted by statute, such as the inclusion of room and board costs in non-institutional settings. CMS will work with states and territories to determine what changes may be needed and other key considerations, such as effective dates and impact to other programs.

218,218,218,218,218,"3. What disaster response options do states have for separate CHIP programs?

States that anticipate needing disaster relief flexibilities in CHIP are encouraged to submit a disaster relief state plan amendment (SPA). This may be submitted in advance of, or in response to, a disaster/public health crisis. Through a CHIP SPA, states can add flexibilities such as waiving premiums and cost sharing, and extending timeframes for renewals. A CHIP SPA may be effective as early as the first day of the state’s fiscal year as long as it is submitted by the end of a state’s fiscal year. Please see the attached link for more information: https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/bytopics/childrens-health-insurance-programchip/downloads/chip_disaster_relief_spa_sample_01102012.pdf

In addition to the disaster relief SPA, states may use CHIP Health Services Initiative (HSI) for additional COVID-19 related activities that are targeted to low-income children. Interested states should consult with CMS regarding the application process and parameters for HSIs.

Yes. Under Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE), states must permit hospitals to make PE determinations for parents and caretaker relatives, children, pregnant women, and former foster care children, adults (in states that have adopted the adult group), individuals eligible for family planning services (if covered by the state), and individuals needing treatment for breast or cervical cancer (if covered by the state.) However, states have the authority to add additional Medicaid eligibility groups or populations (if covered by the state) to their HPE program. This includes eligibility groups based on being age 65 or older, having blindness or a disability, or being medically needy (ex., eligibility group for individuals in institutions eligible under a special income level). States may also permit hospitals to make PE determinations for demonstration populations covered under section 1115 authority. Participating hospitals must meet the state’s qualification requirements and comply with the procedures and standards established by the state. CMS is available to provide technical assistance on the SPA changes needed to expand HPE to these and other eligibility groups.

Yes. States are excused from meeting the timeliness standards for processing applications due to an administrative or other emergency beyond the agency’s control. This would include a public health emergency, like COVID-19, during which workforce shortages may impact the agency’s ability to process applications timely and/or impacted individuals may be unable to receive or respond to notices or provide information needed to complete the application process. To exercise this flexibility, a Medicaid SPA is not needed. States relying on a timeliness standard exception on a case-by-case basis must document the reason for the delay in the individual’s case record.

States seeking to invoke a timeliness standard exception for a broader cohort of cases (for example, all applications in a defined geographic area) are advised to not only document the exception in the applicant’s case record, but also to obtain CMS concurrence that the exception is warranted under the circumstances. CHIP agencies should submit a disaster relief state plan amendment to utilize flexibilities related to application processing. States that already have a disaster relief state plan amendment that includes flexibilities related to application processing will just need to notify CMS that they are activating this flexibility.

This would include a public health emergency, like COVID-19, during which workforce shortages may impact the agency’s ability to complete timely renewals and/or impacted individuals may be unable to receive or respond to notices or provide information needed to complete the renewal process. In such cases, the state must continue to furnish Medicaid to eligible beneficiaries until they are determined ineligible.

223,223,223,223,223,"4. Can a state extend eligibility for current beneficiaries subject to an emergency or disaster so that they can continue to receive coverage beyond their renewal date, even if no longer eligible?

As described above, states have flexibility in meeting the timeliness standards for renewing Medicaid eligibility during an administrative or other emergency beyond the agency’s control. Beyond those flexibilities, for eligibility groups excepted from the MAGI-based methodologies, states have the option to renew eligibility once every 12 months or more frequently than once every 12 months. States that have elected to conduct more frequent renewals for MAGIexcepted groups may submit a state plan amendment to extend the renewal period to 12 months.

Under the Medicaid state plan, states can also elect to extend coverage to certain additional individuals statewide by increasing effective income standards (and, for individuals subject to an asset test, resource standards) for some populations and/or adopt an optional eligibility group to cover other populations, when allowable under the statute. A state plan amendment would be needed to do so. However, income and resource standards and eligibility groups in the state plan may not apply narrowly to only those affected by a particular diagnosis, such as COVID-19. CMS is available to provide technical assistance to states seeking to extend coverage to additional populations during a disaster or other emergency.

CHIP agencies may extend eligibility through a disaster relief state plan amendment. States that already have a disaster relief state plan amendment that includes flexibilities related to extending eligibility will just need to notify CMS that they are activating this flexibility.

",[],coronavirus
225,225,225,225,225,"1. How can states best provide Medicaid services and supports to beneficiaries who are quarantined?

Through a 1915(c) Appendix K, if a Medicaid beneficiary already meeting an institutional level of care is quarantined in the community, states could add Live in Caregiver as a service, authorizing family members as providers. Therefore, a family member in the home who is not ill can render services to the quarantined individual and be funded as a live in caregiver. Homedelivered meals, such as Meals on Wheels, could be added to provide one meal per day to the individual. Additional services, such as private duty nursing, could also be added and payment rates could be increased to account for increased health risk to providers and to solicit a larger provider pool.

Access to Medicaid services provided in an individual’s private home or group residential setting should not change because the beneficiary is quarantined. However, depending on the way the state has developed the benefit and description in the state plan, a SPA may be necessary to amend language to clarify where services may be provided. For benefits with federal requirements governing location, such as benefits that require services to be provided in a home and community based setting, CMS is available to provide technical assistance related to how states can comply with federal requirements in emergencies.

For individuals quarantined in institutional settings, regulations already require that nursing facilities (NFs) and Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IIDs) have an infection control policy, including policies for prevention, surveillance, and isolation. The facilities are already paid for this type of planning and care under their normal per diem rates.

Quarantine in an inpatient hospital setting could be considered an observation bed stay (for the period of observation to determine whether the individual needs an inpatient hospital stay), when covered by the state. Observation bed stays are not specifically mentioned in the federal Medicaid coverage regulations for inpatient or outpatient hospital services (42 C.F.R. §§440.2, 440.10, and 440.20), and states have discretion in whether to cover and how to pay for these services. Observation bed days of 24 hours or longer cannot be covered as an outpatient hospital service, but may be covered as an inpatient hospital stay (the Medicaid definition of outpatient described in 42 C.F.R. § 440.2 limits services to a less than 24-hour period). If a service is tied to a specific setting, the service can be amended either through the state plan and/or through the Appendix K for 1915(c) programs.

226,226,226,226,226,"2. What flexibilities are available to provide care via telehealth for individuals who are quarantined or self-isolated to limit risk of exposure?

States have broad flexibility to cover telehealth through Medicaid, including the methods of communication (such as telephonic, video technology commonly available on smart phones and other devices) to use. Telehealth is important not just for people who are unable to go to the doctor, but also for when it is not advisable to go in person. No federal approval is needed for state Medicaid programs to reimburse providers for telehealth services in the same manner or at the same rate that states pay for face-to-face services. A SPA would be necessary to accommodate any revisions to payment methodologies to account for telehealth costs.

With regard to 1915(i) face-to-face assessments, the use of telemedicine or other information technology medium is authorized under federal regulations at 42 C.F.R. § 441.720 under certain conditions. With regard to 1915(c) waivers, the state can complete an Appendix K to allow case management to be done via telephone or other information technology medium and, where personal care services only require verbal cueing and/or instruction, the personal care service can be expanded to permit information technology medium as a resource.

227,227,227,227,227,"3. Will CMS issue guidance on loosening prior authorization requirements for medication and supplies for medically fragile children and other populations who may be quarantined?

The answer to this question depends on whether the child receives their care through Fee-ForService (FFS) or managed care.

FFS / Supplies: States have flexibility to establish and manage prior authorization processes without CMS approval. Given that medically fragile children are subject to Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) requirements, there should be no hard limits on services provided to these children. A SPA may be needed, depending on the state’s goals.

FFS/Pharmacy: States have flexibility to establish the prior authorization process without CMS approval, including length of time and units approved. A state may need to amend their SPA for a change in quantity dispensed.

Managed Care: Under Medicaid managed care, states may develop the specific standards and criteria that best meet the needs of their program, including accelerated or relaxed requirements during times of emergency. Federal law does not prohibit or limit states from requiring managed care plans to temporarily suspend prior authorization requirements, extend prior authorizations through the termination of the emergency declaration, and expedite processing of new prior authorizations with flexibility in documentation (e.g., physician signatures).
",[],coronavirus
228,228,228,228,228,"4. Will CMS consider adding telehealth flexibilities so residents in rural communities potentially exposed to the virus do not need to visit a Rural Health Clinic (RHC)?

RHCs billing Medicare are subject to Medicare’s telehealth policies. The Medicare statute authorizes RHCs to serve as originating sites for telehealth services furnished by a remotely located “distant site” health care provider, but the statute does not authorize RHCs to furnish telehealth services as distant site health care providers. A distant site is a site at which the physician or other licensed practitioner delivering the service is located at the time the service is provided via telecommunications system. Only physicians and certain types of non-physician practitioners are authorized to furnish telehealth services as distant site health care providers. The Secretary’s waiver authority under section 1135(b) of the Act does not extend to the scope of distant site health care providers that can furnish telehealth services. The newly added paragraph at section 1135(b)(8) gives the Secretary authority only to waive the requirements of 1834(m)(4)(C), which is the definition of “originating site” for purposes of Medicare telehealth services. There is no new authority to waive who/what can serve as the “distant site practitioner.

230,230,230,230,230,"6. Is the test for the detection of COVID-19 coverable under Medicaid’s mandatory laboratory benefit?

Yes, the test meets the criteria for a mandatory laboratory service as described at 1905(a)(3) and 42 C.F.R. § 440.30. The test must be ordered and provided by or under the direction of a physician or other licensed practitioner within the appropriate scope of practice as defined by the state, or ordered by a physician, but provided by referral laboratory. To meet this definition, the test must be provided in an office or similar facility other than a hospital outpatient department or clinic and furnished by a laboratory that meets Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) requirements at Part 493 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Tests that do not meet these criteria may still be covered under the optional diagnostic benefit described at 1905(a)(13) of the Social Security Act and 42 C.F.R. § 440.130(a).

If a state’s current Medicaid cost sharing policies include cost sharing for the test for the detection of COVID-19, the state can submit a SPA to eliminate the cost sharing for that test. For CHIP, states can stop charging copayments for particular items or services through a CHIP disaster relief SPA. More information on cost sharing flexibility is found in question D.1. below.

If a state wishes to stop charging copayments for particular items or services in Medicaid (e.g., doctor visits or inpatient hospital services), the state can submit a SPA. However, exempting individuals from copayments cannot be applied narrowly to only those affected by a particular diagnosis, such as COVID-19. Rather, a copayment exemption under the state plan would need to apply to everyone who accesses a particular item or service. Alternatively, the state could request section 1115 authority to temporarily suspend copayments only for individuals needing treatment for COVID-19 infection.

239,239,239,239,239,"1. What options are available if a state experiences a shortage of health care workers because of COVID-19?

To address provider shortages for individuals receiving 1915(c) waiver services, states can use Appendix K to expand provider qualifications (e.g., where a provider must be 21 years old, states could modify the age requirement to 18); add additional providers (including allowance of payment to family members and legally responsible relatives); add services, such as a live-in care giver; and temporarily adjust rates to entice more individuals into the workforce.

For state plan services, a SPA can increase the types of providers a state authorizes to deliver services. As always, states should be mindful of state-level requirements that might impact provider flexibility in delegation of authority.

Additionally, states have broad ability to cover telehealth through Medicaid, and no federal approval is needed for state Medicaid programs to reimburse for telehealth services in the same manner or at the same rate paid for face-to-face services, visits, or consultations. A SPA is necessary to accommodate any revisions to payment methodology to account for telehealth costs.

To address state staff shortages, the Appendix K process can also be utilized for case managers under 1915(c) to permit the use of telehealth or telephonic consultations in place of typical faceto-face requirements. Under 1915(i), existing regulatory flexibility at 42 C.F.R. § 441.720(a) permits use of telehealth in place of face-to-face assessments when certain conditions are met.

240,240,240,240,240,"2. What precautions can states take to protect home health workers, personal care workers, and eligibility workers from contracting COVID-19?

CMS supports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance on workforce protections; more information can be found on the CDC website:

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/index.html. CMS has also issued relevant guidance at the following link: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-20-17-all.pdf

Any additional guidance will be posted to https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/AgencyInformation/Emergency/EPRO/Current-Emergencies/Current-Emergencies-page .

To account for increased costs in personal protective equipment (PPE) for home care workers, a SPA or Appendix K for a 1915(c) waiver could be submitted to amend payment methodologies for impacted services.

241,241,241,241,241,"3. What flexibility exists to allow states to utilize first responders (emergency medical technicians (EMTs), fire fighters, etc.) to administer testing for COVID-19?

Depending on the specificity in the existing Medicaid state plan, a SPA may be necessary to add first responders as testing providers. CMS notes that state laws may have implications for the  scope of providers able to perform these activities. In addition, third party liability provisions apply for services covered across the Medicaid program, and states could utilize existing mechanisms to ensure compliance.

243,243,243,243,243,"1. What flexibilities will CMS provide states in the event that required deliverables cannot be submitted because of COVID-19 (i.e., SPA, waiver applications, renewals, or deliverables, etc.)?

CMS will monitor pending SPA submissions and 1915(c) waiver amendments and renewals and work closely with the state to ensure the appropriate approvals or temporary extensions are granted.

Regarding managed care reporting requirements, CMS is able to utilize enforcement discretion for managed care reporting requirements under 42 C.F.R. Part 438, with minimal exceptions (actuarial soundness, payments, and Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) requirements). The reporting requirements for MLR at 42 C.F.R. § 438.8(k) are determined by the state, as long as it is within 12 months of the end of the reporting year. CMS believes this provides states an ample window to meet MLR reporting requirements.

Regarding section 1115 demonstration deliverables or renewal requests (such as quarterly and annual monitoring or budget neutrality reports, evaluation designs, evaluation reports), states may e-mail their demonstration’s CMS project officer requesting an extension to submit the deliverable/report or renewal application, along with an explanation of the rationale. As a general rule, if the state experiences challenges as a result of COVID-19, the state should notify CMS as soon as possible and CMS will work with the state to determine a reasonable timeline for compliance.

244,244,244,244,244,"2. In the event of a public health emergency in which a healthcare facility experiences an acute critical staffing shortage, including a staffing shortage due to infectious disease, and temporarily utilizes federal health care workers (e.g., US Public Health Services Commissioned Corps Officers) in place of facility staff, may the facility continue to bill the Medicaid program for the services provided to beneficiaries?

Providers are generally prohibited from billing the Medicaid program and states may not receive FFP for practitioner services provided by federally employed health care workers. To the extent care provided by a federal employee supplants the costs of practitioner or non-practitioner services that are bundled into a rate that includes multiple service costs, the provider’s payment would need to be allocated and the state’s claim for FFP would need to be reduced to account for service costs associated with federally employed practitioners. For example, if a nursing facility is staffed in part by federally employed health care workers and is paid a per diem rate for Medicaid services, the state’s claim of FFP for the per diem rate would need to be reduced for all care costs assumed for services provided by federal workers. In such instances, during a public emergency, the state may continue to pay the nursing facility the full per diem rate and recoup funds from the provider once data is available to properly allocate service costs. Such an allocation may be conducted using cost data from a nursing facility’s cost report or, if feasible, by reducing the per diem rates by cost factors associated with care costs assumed by the federal health care worker. The data used to allocate cost must be auditable and claimed FFP associated with the federally employed worker must be returned to CMS. CMS will work with state to ensure this process is conducted within an appropriate time frame following acceptance of federal assistance. In the interim, states may continue to pay providers in accordance with Medicaid state plan methodologies and CMS will work with the state on a case-by-case basis to ensure that a reasonable allocation method is developed in accordance with applicable cost allocation requirements.

245,245,245,245,245,"3. What is CMS’ coding guidance for laboratory testing of COVID-19 and what are the rates for testing?

CMS is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish the appropriate coding practices related to COVID-19. CMS developed the first Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code (U0001) to pay for claims and track testing for COVID-19. This code is used specifically for CDC testing laboratories to test patients for SARS-CoV-2. CMS has since added a second HCPCS billing code (U0002) which allows laboratories to bill for non-CDC lab tests for SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV (COVID-19). Medicare claims processing systems will be able to accept these codes starting on April 1, 2020, for dates of service on or after February 4, 2020. These codes serve to increase more testing and improve tracking. Because these HCPCS codes allow those labs conducting the tests to bill for the specific test instead of using an unspecified code, a descriptor is not required for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance.

On February 6, 2020, CMS also gave Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)- certified laboratories information about how they can test for SARS-CoV-2. To read more about those efforts, visit: https://www.cms.gov/medicareprovider-enrollment-andcertificationsurveycertificationgeninfopolicy-and-memos-states-and/notification-surveyorsauthorization-emergency-use-cdc-2019-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-real-time-rt

CMS’s 12 local administrative contractors process and pay the fee-for-service Medicare claims for each of their respective jurisdictions. The contractors use a variety of methodologies to price new tests that will be paid at the local level, until a national price is established through CMS’s annual laboratory meeting process that includes the opportunity for public feedback. CMS is actively working with the contractors in this process and will provide information in separate guidance once it is available.

The detection and spread of an emerging respiratory pathogen are accompanied by uncertainty over the key epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of the novel pathogen and particularly its ability to spread in the human population and its virulence (case-severity). This is the case for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), first detected in Wuhan city, China in December 2019 (1).
","[{'text': '2019-nCoV', 'sem_type': 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus', 'concept_id': 'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCBITaxon_2697049', 'start_span': 340, 'end_span': 349}]",coronavirus
315,315,315,315,315,"Closed settings, such as the household, have a defined population that do not mix readily with the larger surrounding community, and therefore such settings provide a strategic way to track emerging respiratory infections and characterize virus transmission patterns because the denominator can be well defined. Also, exposure is within the setting, and follow-up of household contacts is generally more feasible in this well-defined setting as compared to an undefined one.
",[],coronavirus
316,316,316,316,316,"Household setting studies allow us to determine transmission dynamics (reproduction number and serial interval) of the virus as well as to understand the clinical spectrum of illness in secondary cases (2). Closed settings are also useful to observe chains of transmission in an epidemic as the pool of susceptible, exposed individuals is larger. Therefore, in the case of multiple waves of infection through the closed setting, unique insight into transmission dynamics can be derived in the early epidemic stages.
",[],coronavirus
317,317,317,317,317,"To date initial surveillance has focused primarily on patients with severe disease, and, as such, the full spectrum of the disease, including the extent and fraction of mild or asymptomatic infection that do not require medical attention are not clear. Infections identified in close contacts may potentially be generalizable to naturally-acquired infections (in contrast to cases presenting for emergency care among which there would be fewer mild cases). Following close contacts with similar levels of exposure to infection from primary cases can also permit identification of the asymptomatic fraction. Principally, follow-up and testing of respiratory specimens and serum of close contacts can provide useful information about newly identified cases, as well as the spectrum of illness and frequency (by for example age) of asymptomatic and symptomatic infection.
",[],coronavirus
318,318,318,318,318,"With the emergency of a novel coronavirus, initial seroprevalence in the population will be low due to the virus being new in origin. Therefore, surveillance of antibody seroprevalence in a population can allow inferences to be made about the cumulative incidence of infection in the population. Household transmission studies also can provide the opportunity to follow-up confirmed cases to understand antibody kinetics.

319,319,319,319,319,"The following protocol has been designed to investigate household transmission of 2019-nCoV in any country in which 2019-nCoV infection has been reported and households are exposed. Each country may need to tailor some aspects of this protocol to align with public health, laboratory and clinical systems, according to capacity, availability of resources and cultural appropriateness. However, using a standardized protocol such as the protocol described below, epidemiological exposure data and biological samples can be systematically collected and shared rapidly in a format that can be easily aggregated, tabulated and analyzed across many different settings globally for timely estimates of 2019-nCoV infection severity and attack rates, as well as to inform public health responses and policy decisions.

There are three primary objectives of this household transmission study:
1. To better understand the extent of transmission within a household by estimating the secondary infection rate¹ for household contacts at an individual level, and factors associated with any variation in the secondary infection risk.
2. To characterize secondary cases including the range of clinical presentation, risk factors for infection, and the extent and fraction of asymptomatic infections.

This generic protocol was adapted from the protocol entitled “Household Transmission Investigation Protocol for pandemic influenza A(HxNy) in Country X” and “Prospective Study of household transmission of Influenza” by the Consortium for the Standardisation for Influenza Seroepidemiology (CONSISE). CONSISE is a global partnership aiming to develop influenza investigation protocols and standardise seroepidemiology to inform public health policy for pandemic, zoonotic and seasonal influenza. This international partnership was created out of a need, identified during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, for better (standardised, validated) seroepidemiological data to estimate infection attack rates and severity of the pandemic virus and to inform policy decisions.

Singapore and Hong Kong, both of which had severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in 2002–03, provide hope and many lessons to other countries.

391,391,391,391,391,"The course of an epidemic is defined by a series of key factors, some of which are poorly understood at present for COVID-19. The basic reproduction number (R₀), which defines the mean number of secondary cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection, determines the overall number of people who are likely to be infected, or more precisely the area under the epidemic curve. For an epidemic to take hold, the value of R0 must be greater than unity in value. A simple calculation gives the fraction likely to be infected without mitigation. This fraction is roughly 1–1/R0. With R0 values for COVID-19 in China around 2·5 in the early stages of the epidemic,²  we calculate that approximately 60% of the population would become infected. This is a very worst-case scenario for a number of reasons. We are uncertain about transmission in children, some communities are remote and unlikely to be exposed, voluntary social distancing by individuals and communities will have an impact, and mitigation efforts, such as the measures put in place in China, greatly reduce transmission. As an epidemic progresses, the effective reproduction number (R) declines until it falls below unity in value when the epidemic peaks and then decays, either due to the exhaustion of people susceptible to infection or the impact of control measures.

For the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, in most infected people these epidemiological quantities were short with a day or so to infectiousness and a few days of peak infectiousness to others.³ By contrast, for COVID-19, the serial interval is estimated at 4·4–7·5 days, which is more similar to SARS.⁴

The incubation period for COVID-19 is about 5–6 days.⁴ ⁶ Combining this time with a similar length serial interval suggests there might be considerable presymptomatic infectiousness (appendix 1). For reference, influenza A has a presymptomatic infectiousness of about 1–2 days, whereas SARS had little or no presymptomatic infectiousness.⁷ There have been few clinical studies to measure COVID-19 viraemia and how it changes over time in individuals. In one study of 17 patients with COVID-19, peak viraemia seems to be at the end of the incubation period,⁸  pointing to the possibility that viraemia might be high enough to trigger transmission for 1–2 days before onset of symptoms. If these patterns are verified by more extensive clinical virological studies, COVID-19 would be expected to be more like influenza A than SARS. For SARS, peak infectiousness took place many days after first symptoms, hence the success of quarantine of patients with SARS

First, we think that the epidemic in any given country will initially spread more slowly than is typical for a new influenza A strain. COVID-19 had a doubling time in China of about 4–5 days in the early phases.³ Second, the COVID-19 epidemic could be more drawn out than seasonal influenza A, which has relevance for its potential economic impact. Third, the effect of seasons on transmission of COVID-19 is unknown;¹¹ however, with an R0 of 2–3, the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A, which typically has an R0 of around 1·1–1·5.¹² Closely linked to these factors and their epidemiological determinants is the impact of different mitigation policies on the course of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Some of the lessons from analyses of influenza A apply for COVID-19, but there are also differences. Social distancing measures reduce the value of the effective reproduction number R. With an early epidemic value of R₀ of 2·5, social distancing would have to reduce transmission by about 60% or less, if the intrinsic transmission potential declines in the warm summer months in the northern hemisphere.

Avoiding large gatherings of people will reduce the number of super-spreading events; however, if prolonged contact is required for transmission, this measure might only reduce a small proportion of transmissions. Therefore, broader-scale social distancing is likely to be needed, as was put in place in China. This measure prevents transmission from symptomatic and non-symptomatic cases, hence flattening the epidemic and pushing the peak further into the future. Broader-scale social distancing provides time for the health services to treat cases and increase capacity, and, in the longer term, for vaccines and treatments to be developed. Containment could be targeted  to particular areas, schools, or mass gatherings. This approach underway in northern Italy will provide valuable data on the effectiveness of such measures. The greater the reduction in transmission, the longer and flatter the epidemic curve (figure), with the risk of resurgence when interventions are lifted perhaps to mitigate economic impact.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause illness ranging from mild to severe and, in some cases, can be fatal. Symptoms typically include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Some people infected with the virus have reported experiencing other non-respiratory symptoms. Other people, referred to as asymptomatic cases, have experienced no symptoms at all.

According to the CDC, symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure.

433,433,433,433,433,"How COVID-19 Spreads

Although the first human cases of COVID-19 likely resulted from exposure to infected animals, infected people can spread SARS-CoV-2 to other people.

The virus is thought to spread mainly from personto-person, including:

* Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).

* Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has SARS-CoV-2 on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the primary way the virus spreads.

People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (i.e., experiencing fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath). Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this type of asymptomatic transmission with this new coronavirus, but this is also not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

Similar to influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has the potential to cause extensive outbreaks. Under conditions associated with widespread person-toperson spread, multiple areas of the United States and other countries may see impacts at the same time. In the absence of a vaccine, an outbreak may also be an extended event. As a result, workplaces may experience:

* Absenteeism. Workers could be absent because they are sick; are caregivers for sick family members; are caregivers for children if schools or day care centers are closed; have at-risk people at home, such as immunocompromised family members; or are afraid to come to work because of fear of possible exposure.

* Change in patterns of commerce. Consumer demand for items related to infection prevention (e.g., respirators) is likely to increase significantly, while consumer interest in other goods may decline. Consumers may also change shopping patterns because of a COVID-19 outbreak. Consumers may try to shop at off-peak hours to reduce contact with other people, show increased interest in home delivery services, or prefer other options, such as drivethrough service, to reduce person-to-person contact.

* Interrupted supply/delivery. Shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be delayed or cancelled with or without notification.

440,440,440,440,440,"Develop an Infectious Disease Preparedness and Response Plan

If one does not already exist, develop an infectious disease preparedness and response plan that can help guide protective actions against COVID-19.

Stay abreast of guidance from federal, state, local, tribal, and/or territorial health agencies, and consider how to incorporate those recommendations and resources into workplace-specific plans.

Plans should consider and address the level(s) of risk associated with various worksites and job tasks workers perform at those sites. Such considerations may include:

* Where, how, and to what sources of SARS-CoV-2 might workers be exposed, including:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The general public, customers, and coworkers; and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Sick individuals or those at particularly high risk of infection (e.g., international travelers who have visited locations with widespread sustained (ongoing) COVID-19 transmission, healthcare workers who have had unprotected exposures to people known to have, or suspected of having, COVID-19).

* Non-occupational risk factors at home and in community settings.

* Workers’ individual risk factors (e.g., older age; presence of chronic medical conditions, including immunocompromising conditions; pregnancy).

* Controls necessary to address those risks.

Follow federal and state, local, tribal, and/or territorial (SLTT) recommendations regarding development of contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks, such as:

* Increased rates of worker absenteeism.

* The need for social distancing, staggered work shifts, downsizing operations, delivering services remotely, and other exposure-reducing measures.

* Options for conducting essential operations with a reduced workforce, including cross-training workers across different jobs in order to continue operations or deliver surge services.

* Interrupted supply chains or delayed deliveries.

Plans should also consider and address the other steps that employers can take to reduce the risk of worker exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in their workplace, described in the sections below.

441,441,441,441,441,"Prepare to Implement Basic Infection Prevention Measures

For most employers, protecting workers will depend on emphasizing basic infection prevention measures. As appropriate, all employers should implement good hygiene and infection control practices, including:

* Promote frequent and thorough hand washing, including by providing workers, customers, and worksite visitors with a place to wash their hands. If soap and running water are not immediately available, provide alcohol-based hand rubs containing at least 60% alcohol.

* Encourage workers to stay home if they are sick.

* Encourage respiratory etiquette, including covering coughs and sneezes.

* Provide customers and the public with tissues and trash receptacles.

* Employers should explore whether they can establish policies and practices, such as flexible worksites (e.g., telecommuting) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts), to increase the physical distance among employees and between employees and others if state and local health authorities recommend the use of social distancing strategies. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/guidance-business-response.html

* Discourage workers from using other workers’ phones, desks,
offices, or other work tools and equipment, when possible.

* Maintain regular housekeeping practices, including routine cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, equipment, and other elements of the work environment. When choosing cleaning chemicals, employers should consult information on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved disinfectant labels with claims against emerging viral pathogens. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claims are expected to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for use of all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, PPE).

Develop Policies and Procedures for Prompt Identification and Isolation of Sick People, if Appropriate

* Prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at a worksite.

* Employers should inform and encourage employees to self-monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 if they suspect possible exposure.

* Employers should develop policies and procedures for employees to report when they are sick or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. 

* Where appropriate, employers should develop policies and procedures for immediately isolating people who have signs and/or symptoms of COVID-19, and train workers to implement them. Move potentially infectious people to a location away from workers, customers, and other visitors. Although most worksites do not have specific isolation rooms, designated areas with closable doors may serve as isolation rooms until potentially sick people can be removed from the worksite. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html

* Take steps to limit spread of the respiratory secretions of a person who may have COVID-19. Provide a face mask, if feasible and available, and ask the person to wear it, if tolerated. Note: A face mask (also called a surgical mask, procedure mask, or other similar terms) on a patient or other sick person should not be confused with PPE for a worker; the mask acts to contain potentially infectious respiratory secretions at the source (i.e., the person’s nose and mouth).

* If possible, isolate people suspected of having COVID-19 separately from those with confirmed cases of the virus to prevent further transmission—particularly in worksites where medical screening, triage, or healthcare activities occur, using either permanent (e.g., wall/different room) or temporary barrier (e.g., plastic sheeting).

* Restrict the number of personnel entering isolation areas.

* Protect workers in close contact with (i.e., within 6 feet of) a sick person or who have prolonged/repeated contact with such persons by using additional engineering and administrative controls, safe work practices, and PPE. Workers whose activities involve close or prolonged/ repeated contact with sick people are addressed further in later sections covering workplaces classified at medium and very high or high exposure risk.

* Ensure that sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of these policies.

* Talk with companies that provide your business with contract or temporary employees about the importance of sick employees staying home and encourage them to develop non-punitive leave policies.

* Do not require a healthcare provider’s note for employees who are sick with acute respiratory illness to validate their illness or to return to work, as healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy and not able to provide such documentation in a timely way.

* Maintain flexible policies that permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family member. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual.

* Recognize that workers with ill family members may need to stay home to care for them. See CDC’s Interim Guidance for Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in Homes and Residential Communities: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html.

* Be aware of workers’ concerns about pay, leave, safety, health, and other issues that may arise during infectious disease outbreaks. Provide adequate, usable, and appropriate training, education, and informational material about business-essential job functions and worker health and safety, including proper hygiene practices and the use of any workplace controls (including PPE). Informed workers who feel safe at work are less likely to be unnecessarily absent.

* Work with insurance companies (e.g., those providing employee health benefits) and state and local health agencies to provide information to workers and customers about medical care in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.

443,443,443,443,443,"Implement Workplace Controls

Occupational safety and health professionals use a framework called the “hierarchy of controls” to select ways of controlling workplace hazards. In other words, the best way to control a hazard is to systematically remove it from the workplace, rather than relying on workers to reduce their exposure. During a COVID-19 outbreak, when it may not be possible to eliminate the hazard, the most effective protection measures are (listed from most effective to least effective): engineering controls, administrative controls, safe work practices (a type of administrative control), and PPE. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of control measure when considering the ease of implementation, effectiveness, and cost. In most cases, a combination of control measures will be necessary to protect workers from exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

In addition to the types of workplace controls discussed below, CDC guidance for businesses provides employers and workers with recommended SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention strategies to implement in workplaces: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019- ncov/specific-groups/guidance-business-response.html.

444,444,444,444,444,"Engineering Controls

Engineering controls involve isolating employees from workrelated hazards. In workplaces where they are appropriate, these types of controls reduce exposure to hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement. Engineering controls for SARS-CoV-2 include:

* Installing high-efficiency air filters.

* Increasing ventilation rates in the work environment.

* Installing physical barriers, such as clear plastic sneeze guards.

* Installing a drive-through window for customer service.

* Specialized negative pressure ventilation in some settings, such as for aerosol generating procedures (e.g., airborne infection isolation rooms in healthcare settings and specialized autopsy suites in mortuary settings).

445,445,445,445,445,"Administrative Controls

Administrative controls require action by the worker or employer. Typically, administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures to reduce or minimize exposure to a hazard. Examples of administrative controls for SARS-CoV-2 include:

* Encouraging sick workers to stay at home.

* Minimizing contact among workers, clients, and customers by replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications and implementing telework if feasible.

* Establishing alternating days or extra shifts that reduce the total number of employees in a facility at a given time, allowing them to maintain distance from one another while maintaining a full onsite work week.

* Discontinuing nonessential travel to locations with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks. Regularly check CDC travel warning levels at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers.

* Developing emergency communications plans, including a forum for answering workers’ concerns and internet-based communications, if feasible.

* Providing workers with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors (e.g., cough etiquette and care of PPE).

* Training workers who need to use protecting clothing and equipment how to put it on, use/wear it, and take it off correctly, including in the context of their current and potential duties. Training material should be easy to understand and available in the appropriate language and literacy level for all workers.

447,447,447,447,447,"Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

While engineering and administrative controls are considered more effective in minimizing exposure to SARS-CoV-2, PPE may also be needed to prevent certain exposures. While correctly using PPE can help prevent some exposures, it should not take the place of other prevention strategies.

Examples of PPE include: gloves, goggles, face shields, face masks, and respiratory protection, when appropriate. During an outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, recommendations for PPE specific to occupations or job tasks may change depending on geographic location, updated risk assessments for workers, and information on PPE effectiveness in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Employers should check the OSHA and CDC websites regularly for updates about recommended PPE.

http://www.osha.gov/covid-19

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html

All types of PPE must be:

* Selected based upon the hazard to the worker.

* Properly fitted and periodically refitted, as applicable (e.g., respirators).

* Consistently and properly worn when required.

* Regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, as necessary.

* Properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of, as applicable, to avoid contamination of self, others, or the environment.

Employers are obligated to provide their workers with PPE needed to keep them safe while performing their jobs. The types of PPE required during a COVID-19 outbreak will be based on the risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 while working and job tasks that may lead to exposure.

Workers, including those who work within 6 feet of patients known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those performing aerosol-generating procedures, need to use respirators:

* National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved, N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical exams. See OSHA’s Respiratory Protection standard, 29 CFR 1910.134 at https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134.

* When disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators are not available, consider using other respirators that provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. Other types of acceptable respirators include: a R/P95, N/R/P99, or N/R/P100 filtering facepiece respirator; an air-purifying elastomeric (e.g., half-face or full-face) respirator with appropriate filters or cartridges; powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) with high-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter; or supplied air respirator (SAR). See CDC/ NIOSH guidance for optimizing respirator supplies at: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy. 

* Consider using PAPRs or SARs, which are more protective than filtering facepiece respirators, for any work operations or procedures likely to generate aerosols (e.g., cough induction procedures, some dental procedures, invasive specimen collection, blowing out pipettes, shaking or vortexing tubes, filling a syringe, centrifugation).

* Use a surgical N95 respirator when both respiratory protection and resistance to blood and body fluids is needed.

* Face shields may also be worn on top of a respirator to prevent bulk contamination of the respirator. Certain respirator designs with forward protrusions (duckbill style) may be difficult to properly wear under a face shield. Ensure that the face shield does not prevent airflow through the respirator.

* Consider factors such as function, fit, ability to decontaminate, disposal, and cost. OSHA’s Respiratory Protection eTool provides basic information on respirators such as medical requirements, maintenance and care, fit testing, written respiratory protection programs, and voluntary use of respirators, which employers may also find beneficial in training workers at: https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/respiratory. Also see NIOSH respirator guidance at: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/respirators.

* Respirator training should address selection, use (including donning and doffing), proper disposal or disinfection, inspection for damage, maintenance, and the limitations of respiratory protection equipment. Learn more at: https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/respiratoryprotection.

* The appropriate form of respirator will depend on the type of exposure and on the transmission pattern of COVID-19. See the NIOSH “Respirator Selection Logic” at: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2005-100/default.html or the OSHA “Respiratory Protection eTool” at https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/respiratory

Existing OSHA standards may apply to protecting workers from exposure to and infection with SARS-CoV-2.

While there is no specific OSHA standard covering SARSCoV-2 exposure, some OSHA requirements may apply to preventing occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Among the most relevant are:

* OSHA’s Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) standards (in general industry, 29 CFR 1910 Subpart I), which require using gloves, eye and face protection, and respiratory protection. See: https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910#1910_Subpart_I.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o When respirators are necessary to protect workers or where employers require respirator use, employers must implement a comprehensive respiratory protection program in accordance with the Respiratory Protection standard (29 CFR 1910.134). See: https://www.osha.gov/lawsregs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134.

* The General Duty Clause, Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970, 29 USC 654(a)(1), which requires employers to furnish to each worker “employment and a place of employment, which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.” See: https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/oshact/completeoshact.

OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogens standard (29 CFR 1910.1030 https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1030) applies to occupational exposure to human blood and other potentially infectious materials that typically do not include respiratory secretions that may transmit SARS-CoV-2. However, the provisions of the standard offer a framework that may help control some sources of the virus, including exposures to body fluids (e.g., respiratory secretions) not covered by the standard. See: https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1030. 

The OSHA COVID-19 webpage provides additional information about OSHA standards and requirements, including requirements in states that operate their own OSHA-approved State Plans, recordkeeping requirements and injury/illness recording criteria, and applications of standards related to sanitation and communication of risks related to hazardous chemicals that may be in common sanitizers and sterilizers.

Worker risk of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during an outbreak may vary from very high to high, medium, or lower (caution) risk. The level of risk depends in part on the industry type, need for contact within 6 feet of people known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS-CoV-2, or requirement for repeated or extended contact with persons known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS-CoV-2. To help employers determine appropriate precautions, OSHA has divided job tasks into four risk exposure levels: very high, high, medium, and lower risk. The Occupational Risk Pyramid shows the four exposure risk levels in the shape of a pyramid to represent probable distribution of risk. Most American workers will likely fall in the lower exposure risk (caution) or medium exposure risk levels.

It is recommended that this guidance be used with the World Health Organization (WHO) Handbook for management of public health events on board ships (1).

The target audience for this document is any authority involved in the public health response to a COVID-19 public health event on board a ship, including International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Points (NFPs), port health authorities, and local, provincial and national health surveillance and response systems, as well as port operators and ship operators.

Passenger ships sailing on an international voyage are advised to develop a written plan for disease outbreak management that covers the definitions of a suspected case of COVID-19 disease, the definition of close contacts and an isolation plan. The outbreak management plan should include descriptions of the following:

* the location or locations where suspected cases will be isolated individually until disembarkation and transfer to a healthcare facility;

* how the necessary communications between departments (for example, medical, housekeeping, laundry, room service) about persons in isolation will be managed;

* the clinical management of suspected cases while they remain on board;

* cleaning and disinfection procedures for potentially contaminated areas, including the isolation cabins or areas;

* how close contacts of the suspected case will be managed;

* procedures to collect Passenger/Crew Locator Forms (PLF);

* how food service and utensils, waste management services and laundry will be
provided to the isolated travellers.

Staff on board should have knowledge of the outbreak management plan and should implement it as required.

Staff involved in transporting suspected cases should apply infection control practices by following WHO’s guidance (5, 6). These practices are summarized below.

* When loading patients into the ambulance, transport staff, including medical staff, should routinely perform hand hygiene and wear a medical mask, eye protection (goggles or a face shield), a long-sleeved gown and gloves.

* Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be changed after loading each patient and disposed of appropriately in containers with a lid and in accordance with national regulations for disposing of infectious waste.

* The driver of the ambulance must remain separate from the cases (keeping at least 1 m distance). No PPE is required if distance can be maintained or a physical separation exists. If drivers must also help load the patients into the ambulance, they should follow the PPE recommendations in the previous point.

* Transport vehicles must have as high a volume of air exchange as possible (for example, by opening the windows).

* Transport staff should frequently clean their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water and ensure that they clean their hands before putting on PPE and after removing it.

* Ambulances and transport vehicles should be cleaned and disinfected, with particular attention paid to the areas in contact with the suspected case. Cleaning should be done with regular household soap or detergent first and then, after rinsing, regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (that is, equivalent to 5000 ppm or 1 part bleach to 9 parts water) should be applied.

In the event that the affected ship calls at a port other than the turnaround port, the port health authority should conduct a risk assessment and may decide in consultation with the ship’s owner to end the cruise. The ship should be inspected according to Article 27 of the IHR (2005), which discusses affected conveyances, and then health measures (such as cleaning and disinfection) should be applied based on the findings of the inspection. Detailed guidance from WHO is available in the Handbook for inspection of ships and issuance of ship sanitation certificates (10). For more details about the inspection, see the section on environmental investigation in this document. Infectious waste should be disposed of in accordance with the port authority’s procedures. Health measures implemented on the ship should be noted in the Ship Sanitation Certificate.

There are three primary objectives of this investigation among health care workers in a health care setting where a 2019-nCoV infected patient is being cared for:
1. To better understand the extent of human-to-human transmission among health care workers, by estimating the secondary infection rate¹ for health care worker contacts at an individual level.
2. To characterize the range of clinical presentation of infection and the risk factors for infection among health care workers.
3. To evaluate effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures among health care workers

This generic protocol was adapted from the protocol entitled “Assessment of potential risk factors of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection among health care personnel in a health care setting” by WHO and “Prospective Study of household transmission of Influenza” by the Consortium for the Standardisation for Influenza Seroepidemiology (CONSISE). CONSISE is a global partnership aiming to develop influenza investigation protocols and standardise seroepidemiology to inform public health policy for pandemic, zoonotic and seasonal influenza. This international partnership was created out of a need, identified during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, for better (standardised, validated) seroepidemiological data to estimate infection attack rates and severity of the pandemic virus and to inform policy decisions.

* WHO Director-General in his regular media briefing today stated that WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction. WHO therefore have made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic. For detailed information, please see here. 

* Four new countries/territories/areas (Bolivia [Plurinational State of], Jamaica, Burkina Faso and Democratic Republic of the Congo) have reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours. 

* The COVID-19 virus infects people of all ages. However, evidence to date suggests that two groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease. These are older people; and those with underlying medical conditions. WHO emphasizes that all must protect themselves from COVID-19 in order to protect others. For more information, please see 'subject in focus'. 

* On 10 March, the IFRC, UNICEF and WHO issued a new guidance to help protect children and schools from transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The guidance provides critical considerations and practical checklists to keep schools safe.

| --- |
| WHO's strategic objectives for this response are to: |
| • Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread*; |
| • Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients; |
| • Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source; |
| • Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines; |
| • Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation; |
| • Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships. |
| |
| * This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in health care settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population and risk communication. |

If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is spreading or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate information on COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).

https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public

If you are in an area where there are cases of COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people, COVID-19 infection will cause mild illness however, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, it can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes) are at risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).

Faced with an unknown virus, sharing and collaboration are the best remedy.

The publication of this Handbook is one of the best ways to mark the courage and wisdom our healthcare workers have demonstrated over the past two months.

Thanks to all those who have contributed to this Handbook, sharing the invaluable experience with healthcare colleagues around the world while saving the lives of patients.

Thanks to the support from healthcare colleagues in China who have provided experience that inspires and motivates us.

Thanks to Jack Ma Foundation for initiating this program, and to AliHealth for the technical support, making this Handbook possible to support the fight against the epidemic.

657,657,657,657,657,"Foreword

This is an unprecedented global war, and mankind is facing the same enemy, the novel corona-virus. And the first battlefield is the hospital where our soldiers are the medical workers.

To ensure that this war can be won, we must first make sure that our medical staff is guaranteed sufficient resources, including experience and technologies. Also, we need to make sure that the hospital is the battleground where we eliminate the virus, not where the virus defeats us.

Therefore, the Jack Ma Foundation and Alibaba Foundation have convened a group of medical experts who have just returned from the frontlines of fighting the pandemic. With the support of The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (FAHZU), they quickly published a guidebook on the clinical experience of how to treat this new coronavirus. The treatment guide offers advice and reference against the pandemic for medical staff around the world who are about to join the war.

My special thanks goes out to the medical staff from FAHZU. While taking huge risks in treating COVID-19 patients, they recorded their daily experience which is reflected in this Handbook. Over the past so days, 104 confirmed patients have been admitted to FAHZU, including 78 severe and critically ill ones. Thanks to the pioneering efforts of medical staff and the application of new technologies, to date, we have witnessed a miracle. No staff were infected, and there were no missed diagnosis or patient deaths.

Today, with the spread of the pandemic, these experiences are the most valuable sources of information and the most important weapon for medical workers on the frontline. This is a brand-new disease, and China was the first to suffer from the pandemic. Isolation, diagnosis, treatment, protective measures, and rehabilitation have all started from scratch. WE hope that this Handbook can provide doctors and nurses in other affected areas va luable information so they don't have to enter the battlefield alone.

This pandemic is a common challenge faced by mankind in the age of globalization. At this moment, sharing resources, experiences and lessons, regardless of who you are, is our only chance to win. The real remedy for this pandemic is not isolation, but cooperation. This war has just begun.

FAHZU is a designated hospital for COVID-19 patients, especially severe and critically ill individuals whose condition changes rapidly, often with multiple organs infected and requiring the support from the multidisciplinary team (MDT). Since the outbreak, FAHZU established an expert team composed of doctors from the Departments of Infectious Diseases, Respiratory Medicine, ICU, Laboratory Medicine, Radiology, Ultrasound, Pharmacy, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Psychology, Respiratory Therapy, Rehabilitation, Nutrition, Nursing, etc. A comprehensive multidisciplinary diagnosis and treatment mechanism has been established in which doctors both inside and outside the isolation wards can discuss patients'conditions every day via video conference. This allows for them to determine scientific, integrated and customized treatment strategies for every severe and critically ill patient.

Sound decision-making is the key to MDT discussion. During the discussion, experts from different departments focus on issues from their specialized fields as well as critical issues to diagnoses and treatment. The final treatment solution is determined by experienced experts through various discussions of different opinions and advice.

Systematic analysis is at the core of MDT discussion. Elderly patients with underlying health conditions are prone to becoming critically ill. While closely monitoring the progression of COVID-19, the patient's basic status, complications and daily examination results should be analyzed comprehensively to see how the disease will progress. It is necessary to intervene in advance to stop the disease from deteriorating and to take proactive measures such as antivirals, oxygen therapy, and nutritional support.

The goal of MDT discussion is to achieve personalized treatment. The treatment plan should be adjusted to each person when considering the differences among individuals, courses of disease, and patient types.

Our experience is that MDT collaboration can greatly improve the effectiveness of the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.

Sputum and other lower respiratory tract specimens have a high positive rate of nucleic acids and should be collected preferentially. SARS-CoV-2 preferentially proliferates in type II alveolar cells (AT2) and peak of viral shedding appears 3 to 5 days after the onset of disease. Therefore, if the nucleic acid test is negative at the beginning, samples should continue to be collected and tested on subsequent days.

712,712,712,712,712,"1.2 Nucleic Acid Detection

Nucleic acid testing is the preferred method for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The testing process according to the kit instructions is as follows: Specimens are pre-processed, and the virus is lysed to extract nucleic acids. The three specific genes of SARS-CoV-2, namely the Open Reading Frame la/b (ORFla/b), nucleocapsid protein (N), and envelope protein (E) genes, are then amplified by real-time quantitative PCR technology. The amplified genes are detected by fluorescence intensity. Criteria of positive nucleic acid results are: ORFla/b gene is positive, and/or N gene/E gene are positive.

The combined detection of nucleic acids from multiple types of specimens can improve the diagnostic accuracy. Among patients with confirmed positive nucleic acid in respiratory tract, about 30% - 40% of these patients have detected viral nucleic acid in the blood and about 50% - 60% of patients have detected viral nucleic acid in feces. However, the positive rate of nucleic acid testing in urine samples is quite low. Combined testing with specimens from respiratory tract, feces, blood and other types of specimens is helpful for improving the diagnostic sensitivity of suspected cases, monitoring treatment efficacy and the management of post-discharge isolation measures.

It is recommended to conduct tests of (-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, total and subpopulations of lymphocytes, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, INF-y and other indicators of inflammation and immune status, which can help evaluate clinical progress, alert severe and critical tendencies, and provide a basis for the formulation of treatment strategies.

Most patients with C0VID-19 have a normal level of procalcitonin with significantly increased levels of C-reactive protein. A rapid and significantly elevated (-reactive protein level indicates a possibility of secondary infection. D-dimer levels are significantly elevated in severe cases, which is a potential risk factor for poor prognosis. Patients with a low total number of lymphocytes at the beginning of the disease generally have a poor prognosis. Severe patients have a progressively decreased number of peripheral blood lymphocytes. The expression levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in severe patients are increased greatly. Monitoring the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 is helpful to assess the risk of progression to a severe condition.

If secondary lung infection is suspected, sputum coughed from deep in the lungs, tracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and brush specimens should be collected for culture. Timely blood culture should be performed in patients with high fever.

718,718,718,718,718,"III. Imaging Findings of COVID-19 Patients

Thoracic imaging is of great value in the diagnosis of C0VID-19, monitoring of therapeutic efficacy, and patient discharge assessment. A high-resolution CT is highly preferable. Portable chest X-rays are helpful for critically ill patients who are immobile. CT for baseline evaluation of patients with C0VID-19 is usually performed on the day of admission, or if ideal therapeutic efficacy is not reached, it can be re-performed after 2 to 3 days. If symptoms are stable or improved after treatment, the chest CT scan can be reviewed after 5 to 7 days. Daily routine portable chest X-rays are recommended for critically ill patients.

C0VID-19 at the early stage often presents with multifocal patchy shadows or ground glass opacities located in the lung periphery, subpleural area, and both lower lobes on chest CT scans. The long axis of the lesion is mostly parallel to the pleura. Interlobular septa I thickening and intralobular interstitial thickening, displaying as subpleural reticulation namely a ""crazy paving"" pattern, is observed in some ground glass opacities. A small number of cases may show solitary, local lesions, or nodular/ patchy lesion distributed consistent with bronchus with peripheral ground glass opacities changes. Disease progression mostly occurs in the course of 7-10 days, with enlarged and increased density of the lesions compared with previous images, and consolidated lesions with air bronchogram sign. Critical cases may show further expanded consolidation, with the whole lung density showing increased opacity, sometimes known as a ""white lung"". After the condition is relieved, the ground glass opacities can be completely absorbed, and some consolidation lesions will leave fibrotic stripes or subpleural reticulation. Patients with multiple lobular involvement, especially those with expanded lesions should be observed for disease exacerbation. Those with typical CT pulmonary manifestations should be isolated and undergo continuous nucleic acid tests even if the nucleic acid test of SAR-CoV-2 is negative.

Flexible bronchoscopy is versatile, easy to use, and well tolerated in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Its applications include:

(1) Collection of respiratory specimens from the lower respiratory tract (i.e. sputum, endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage) for SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens guides the selection of appropriate antimicrobials, which may lead to clinical benefits. Our experience indicates that lower respiratory specimens are more likely to be positive for SAR-CoV-2 than upper respiratory specimens.

(2) Can be used for localization of the site of bleeding, cessation of hemoptysis, sputum or blood clots removal; if the site of bleeding is identified by bronchoscopy, local injection of cold saline, epinephrine, vasopressin, or fibrin as well as laser treatment can be performed via the bronchoscope.

(3) Assist in the establishment of artificial airways; guide tracheal intubation or percutane-ous tracheotomy.

(4) Drugs such as infusion of a-interferon and N-acetylcysteine can be administrated via the bronchoscope.

720,720,720,720,720,"V. Diagnosis and Clinical Classification of COVID-19

Early diagnosis, treatment and isolation should be carried out whenever possible. Dynamic monitoring of lung imaging, oxygenation index and cytokine levels are helpful for early identification of patients who may develop into severe and critical cases. A positive result of the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, considering the possibility of false negatives in nucleic acid detection, suspected cases characteristic manifestations in CT scans can be treated as confirmed cases even if the nucleic acid test is negative. Isolation and continuous tests of multiple specimens should be carried out in such cases.

The diagnostic criteria follow Protocols for the Diagnosis and Treatment of CDVID-2019. A confirmed case is based on epidemiological history (including cluster transmission), clinical manifestations (fever and respiratory symptoms), lung imaging, and results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection and serum-specific antibodies.

Clinical Classifications:

(1) Mild Cases

The clinical symptoms are mild and no pneumonia manifestations can be found in imaging.

(2) Moderate Cases

Patients have symptoms such as fever and respiratory tract symptoms, etc. and pneumonia manifestations can be seen in imaging.

(3) Severe Cases

Adults who meet any of the following criteria: respiratory rate ;;, 30 breaths/min; oxygen saturations; 93% at a rest state; arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO,)/oxy-gen concentration (FiO,) s; 300 mm Hg. Patients with> 50% lesions progression within 24 to 48 hours in lung imaging should be treated as severe cases.

(4) Critical Cases

Meeting any of the following criteria: occurrence of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; presence of shock; other organ failure that requires monitoring and treatment in the ICU.

Critical cases are further divided into early, middle and late stages according to the oxygenation index and compliance of respiratory system.

* Early stage: 100 mmHg <oxygenation index ≤150 mm Hg; compliance of respiratory system ≥30 ml/cmH₂O; without organ failure other than the lungs. The patient has a great chance of recovery through active antiviral, anti-cytokine storm, and supportive treatment.

* Middle stage: 60 mmHg < oxygenation index ≤100 mm Hg; 30 mL/cmH₂O > compliance of respiratory system ≥15 mL/cmH₂O; may be complicated by other mild or moderate dysfunction of other organs.

• Late stage: oxygenation index ≤60 mmHg; compliance of respiratory system <15 mL/cmH₂O; diffuse consolidation of both lungs that requires the use of ECMO; or failure of other vital organs. The mortality risk is significantly increased.

721,721,721,721,721,"VI. Antiviral Treatment for Timely Elimination of Pathogens

An early antiviral treatment can reduce the incidence of severe and critical cases. Although there is no clinical evidence for effective antiviral drugs, currently the antiviral strategies based on the characteristics of SAR-CoV-2 are adopted according to Protocols for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19: Prevention, Control, Diagnosis and Management.

1. Antiviral Treatment

At FAHZU, lopinavir/ritonavir (2 capsules, po q12h} combined with arbidol (200 mg po ql 2h) were applied as the basic regimen. From the treatment experience of 49 patients in our hospital, the average time to achieve negative viral nucleic acid test for the first time was 12 days (95% Cl: 8-15 days). The duration of negative nucleic acid test result (negative for more than 2 times consecutively with interval<! 24h} was 13.5 days (95% Cl: 9.5 - 17.5 days).

If the basic regimen is not effective, chloroquine phosphate can be used on adults between 18-65 years old (weight<! so kg: 500 mg bid; weight ~so kg: 500 mg bid for first two days, 500 mg qd for following five days).

Interferon nebulization is recommended in Protocols for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19. We recommend that it should be performed in negative-pressure wards rather than general wards due to the possibility of aerosol transmission.

Darunavir/cobicistat has some degree of antiviral activity in viral suppression test in vitro, based on the treatment experience of AIDS patients, and the adverse events are relatively mild. For patients who are intolerant to lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/ cobicistat (1 tablet qd) or favipiravir (starting dose of 1600 mg followed by 600 mg tid) is an alternative option after the ethical review. Simultaneous use of three or more antiviral drugs is not recommended.

2. Course of Treatment

The treatment course of chloroquine phosphate should be no more than 7 days. The treatment course of other regimens has not been determined and are usually around 2 weeks. Antiviral drugs should be stopped if nucleic acid test results from sputum specimens remain negative for more than 3 times.

The artificial liver support system (ALSS) can conduct plasma exchange, adsorption, perfusion, and filtration of inflammatory mediators such as endotoxins and harmful metabolic substances of small or medium molecular weight. It can also provide serum albumin, coagulation factors, balance fluid volume, electrolytes and acid-base ratio, and manifest anti-cytokine storms, shock, lung inflammation, et al. In doing so it can also help to improve multiple organ functions including the liver and kidney. Thus, it can increase treatment success and reduce the mortality of severe patients.

There is no absolute contraindication in the treatment of critically ill patients. However, ALSS should be avoided in the following situations:

(1) Severe bleeding disease or disseminated intravascular coagulation;
(2) Those who are highly allergic to blood components or drugs used in the treatment process such as plasma, heparin and protamine;
(3) Acute cerebrovascular diseases or severe head injury;
(4) Chronic cardiac failure, cardiac functional classification ≥ grade III;
(5) Uncontrolled hypotension and shock;
(6) Severe arrhythmia.

Plasma exchange combined with plasma adsorption or dual plasma molecular adsorption, perfusion, and filtration is recommended according to the patients' situation. 2000 ml of plasma should be exchanged when ALSS is performed. Detailed operating procedures can be found in the Expert Consensus on the Application of Artificial Liver Blood Purification System in the Treatment of Severe and Critical Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia.

ALSS significantly reduces the time that critically ill patients stay in the ICU in our hospital. Typically, the levels of serum cytokines such as IL-2/IL-4/IL-6/TNF-a are remarkably decreased, and oxygen saturation is significantly improved after ALSS.

731,731,731,731,731,"3.1 Oxygen therapy

(1) Continual oxygen saturation monitoring during oxygen therapy

Some patients do not necessarily have impaired oxygenation functions at the onset of infection but may manifest rapid deterioration in oxygenation over time. Therefore, continual monitoring of oxygen saturation is recommended, before and during oxygen therapy.

{2) Oxygen therapy as soon as possible

Oxygen therapy is not necessary for patients with oxygen saturation (SpO 2) of more than 93% or for patients without obvious symptoms of respiratory distress without oxygen treatment. Oxygen therapy is strongly recommended to the patients with symptoms of respiratory distress. It should be noted that some severe patients with PaO/FiO 2 < 300 had no obvious symptoms of respiratory distress.

{3) Treatment goal of oxygen therapy

The treatment goal of oxygen therapy is to maintain the oxygen saturation {SpO 2) at 93%-96% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease and at 88%-92% for patients with chronic type II respiratory failure. Specially, the oxygen concentration should be increased to 92%-95% for patients whose SpO 2 drops below 85% frequently during daily activities.

(4) Control oxygen therapy

PaO₂/FiO₂ is a sensitive and accurate indicator of oxygenation function. The stability and monitorability of FiO₂ are very important for patients with disease progression and PaO₂/FiO₂ below 300 mmHg. Controlled oxygen therapy is the preferred treatment

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy is recommended for patients with the following conditions: SpO₂ < 93%; PaO₂/FiO₂ < 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); respiratory rate> 25 times per min at bed; or remarkable progression on X-ray imaging. Patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment. The airflow of HFNC oxygen therapy should start at a low level and gradually increased up to 40-60 L/min when PaO₂/FiO₂ is between 200-300 mm Hg so that patients do not feel obvious chest tightness and shortness of breath. An initial flow of at least 60 L/min should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress.

Tracheal intubation for patients is dependent on disease progression, systemic status and complication of patients for those with stable situation but with a low oxygenation index (<100 mmHg). Thus, detailed evaluations of the clinical condition of patients is very important before decision making. Tracheal intubation should be performed as early as possible for patients with an oxygenation index less than 150 mm Hg, worsening symptoms of respiratory distress or multiple organ dysfunction within 1-2 hours after high-flow (60 L/min) and high-concentration(> 60%) HFNC oxygen therapy.

Older patients (> 60 years old) with more complications or PaO₂/FiO₂ less than 200 mmHg should be treated in ICU.

732,732,732,732,732,"3.2 Mechanical Ventilation

(1) Noninvasive Ventilation (NIV)

NIV is not strongly recommended in COVID-19 patients who fail HFNC treatment. Some severe patients progress to ARDS rapidly. Excessive inflation pressure may cause gastric distension and intolerance which contribute to aspiration and worsen lung injury. A short-term (less than 2 hours) use of NIV can be closely monitored if the patient has acute left heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or is immunocompromised. Intubation should be performed as early as possible if improvement of respiratory distress symptoms or PaO₂/FiO₂ is not observed.

NIV with a double circuit is recommended. A virus filter should be installed between the mask and the exhalation valve when applying NIV with a single tube. Suitable masks should be chosen to reduce the risk of virus spread through air leakage.

(2) Invasive Mechanical Ventilation

(1) Principles of invasive mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients

It is important to balance the ventilation and oxygenation demands and the risk of mechanical ventilation-related lung injury in the treatment of COVID-19.

* Strictly set the tidal volume to 4 - 8 ml/kg. In general, the lower the lung compliance, the smaller the preset tidal volume should be.

* Maintain the platform pressure< 30 cmH₂O (1 cmH₂O = 0.098 kPa) and driving pressure <15 cmH₂O.

* Set PEEP according to the ARDS's protocol.

* Ventilation frequency: 18-25 times per minute. Moderate hypercapnia is allowed.

* Administer sedation, analgesia, or muscle relaxant if the tidal volume, platform pressure and driving pressure are too high.

(2) Lung Recruitment

Lung recruitment improves the heterogeneous distribution of lesions in patients with ARDS. However, it may result in severe respiratory and circulatory complications and therefore, the lung recruitment maneuver is not routinely recommended. The assessment of lung expandability should be performed prior to the application.

(3) Prone Position Ventilation

Most critically ill patients with COVID-19 respond well to prone ventilation, with a rapid improvement of oxygenation and lung mechanics. Prone ventilation is recommended as a routine strategy for patients with PaO₂/FiO₂ < 150 mmHg or with obvious imaging manifestations without contraindications. Time course recommended for prone ventilation is more than 16 hours each time. The prone ventilation can be ceased once PaO₂/FiO₂ is greater than 150 mm Hg for more than 4 hours in the supine position.

Prone ventilation while awake may be attempted for patients who have not been intubated or have no obvious respiratory distress but with impaired oxygenation or have consolidation in gravity-dependent lung zones on lung images. Procedures for at least 4 hours each time is recommended. Prone position can be considered several times per day depending on the effects and tolerance.

(4) Prevention of Regurgitation and Aspiration

Gastric residual volume and gastrointestinal function should be routinely evaluated. Appropriate enteral nutrition is recommended to be given as earlier as possible. Nasointestinal feeding and continuous nasogastric decompression are recommended. Enteral nutrition should be suspended and aspiration with so ml syringe be done before transfer. If no contraindication exists, a 30° semi-sitting position is recommended.

(5) Fluid Management

Excessive fluid burden worsens hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients. To reduce pulmonary exudation and improve oxygenation, the amount of fluid should be strictly controlled while ensuring the patient's perfusion.

{6) Strategies to Prevent Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)

VAP bundled strategies should be strictly implemented:

(1) Select appropriate type of endotracheal tube;
(2) Use a endotracheal tube with subglottic suction (once every 2 hours, aspirated with 20 ml empty syringe each time);
(3) Place the endotracheal tube at the right position and correct depth, fix properly and avoid pulling;
(4) Maintain the airbag pressure at 30 - 35 cmH₂O (1 cmH₂O = 0.098 kPa) and monitor every 4 hours;
(5) Monitor the airbag pressure and deal with water condensates when the position changes (two people cooperate in dumping and pouring the water condensates into a capped container containing a pre-made disinfectant chlorine solution); deal with secretions accumulated in the airbag;
(6) Clean up secretions from the mouth and nose timely.

(7) Weaning of Ventilation

Sedatives is reduced and discontinued before awakening when the patient's PaO₂/FiO₂ is more than 150 mmHg. Intubation withdrawal should be performed as earlier as possible if permitted. HFNC or NIV is used for sequential respiratory support after withdrawal.

733,733,733,733,733,"VIII. The Rational Use of Antibiotics to Prevent Secondary Infection

COVID-19 is a disease of viral infection, therefore antibiotics are not recommended to prevent bacterial infection in mild or ordinary patients; it should be used carefully in severe patients based on their conditions. Antibiotics can be used with discretion in patients who have the following conditions: extensive lung lesions; excess bronchial secretions; chronic airway diseases with a history of pathogen colonization in the lower respiratory tract; taking glucocorticoids with a dosage<! 20 mg x 7d (in terms of prednisone). The options of antibiotics include quinolones, the second or third generation cephalothins, β-lactamase inhibitor compounds, etc. The antibiotics should be used for the prevention of bacterial infection in critically severe patients, especially those with invasive mechanical ventilation. The antibiotics such as carbapenems, β-lactamase inhibitor compounds, linezolid and vancomycin can be used in critically ill patients according to the individual risk factors.

The patient's symptoms, signs and indicators such as blood routine, c-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, need to be closely monitored during the treatment. When the change of a patient's condition is detected, a comprehensive clinical judgment needs to be made. When the secondary infection cannot be ruled out, qualified specimen need to be collected for testing by smear preparation, cultivation, nucleic acid, antigen and antibody, in order to determine the infectious agent as early as possible. Antibiotics can be empirically used in the following conditions: (1) more expectoration, darker sputum color, especially yellow pus sputum; (2) the rise of body temperature which is not due to exacerbation of the original disease; (3) the marked increase of white blood cells and/or neutrophils; (4) procalcitonin ≥ 0.5 ng/mL; (5) Exacerbation of oxygenation index or circulatory disturbance that are not caused by the viral infection; and the other conditions suspiciously caused by bacteria infections.

Some COVID-19 patients are at the risk of secondary fungal infections due to weakened cellular immunity caused by viral infections, the use of glucocorticoid and/or broad-spectrum antibiotics.

(1) Oral feeding is preferred. The early intestinal nutrition can provide nutritional support, nourish intestines, improve intestinal mucosa I barrier and intestinal immunity, and maintain intestinal microecology.

(2) Enteral nutrition pathway. Severe and critically ill patients often harbor acute gastrointestinal damages, manifested as abdominal distension, diarrhea, and gastroparesis. For patients with tracheal intubation, intestinal nutrition tube indwelling is recommended for post-pyloric feeding.

(3) Selection of nutrient solution. For patients with intestinal damage, predigested short peptide preparations, which are easy for intestinal absorption and utilization, are recommended. For patients with good intestinal functions, whole-protein preparations with relatively high calories can be selected. For hyperglycemia patients, nutritional preparations which are beneficial to glycemic controlling are recommended.

(4) Energy supply. 25-30 kcal per kg body weight, the target protein content is 1.2-2.0 g/kg daily.

(5) Means of nutritional supply. Pump infusion of nutrients can be used at a uniform speed, starting with a low dosage and gradually increasing. When possible, the nutrients can be heated before feeding to reduce intolerance.

(6) The elderly patients who are at high aspiration risks or patients with apparent abdominal distention can be supported by parenteral nutrition temporarily. It can be gradually replaced by independent diet or enteral nutrition after their condition improves.

Since Behring and Kitasato reported the therapeutic effects of diphtheria antitoxin plasma in 1891, plasma therapy has become an important means of pathogen immunotherapy for acute infectious diseases. The disease progression is rapid for severe and critically ill patients of an emerging infectious disease. In the early phase, the pathogens damage the target organs directly and then lead to severe immuno-pathological damage. The passive immune antibodies can effectively and directly neutralize the pathogens, which reduces the damage of the target organs and then block the subsequent immune-pathological damages. During multiple global pandemic outbreaks, WHO also emphasized that ""convalescent plasma therapy is one of the most recommended potential therapies, and it has been used during other epidemic outbreaks"". Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the initial mortality rate was rather high due to the lack of specific and effective treatments. As mortality rate is an important metric that the public concerns, clinic treatments which can reduce the fatality rate of critical cases effectively are key to avoid public panic. As a provincial-level hospital in Zhejiang province, we have been responsible to treat the patients from Hangzhou and the critically ill patients of the province. There are abundant potential convalescent plasma donors and critically ill patients who need convalescent plasma treatment in our hospital.

COVID-19 can be divided into early, middle, critical and recovery stages. At the early stage, the disease has two main types: ""wet lungs"" and ""external cold and internal heat."" The middle stage is characterized by ""intermittent cold and heat."" The critical stage is characterized by ""internal block of epidemic toxin."" The recovery stage is characterized by ""qi deficiency in lung-spleen."" The disease initially belongs to wet lung syndrome. Due to fever, both intermittent cold and heat treatments are recommended. In the middle stage, cold, dampness, and heat coexist, belonging to ""cold-heat mixture"" in terms of TCM. Both cold and heat therapy should be considered. According to the theory of TCM, heat should be treated with cold drugs. But cold drugs impair Yang and lead to a cold spleen and stomach and cold-heat mixture in the middle-Jiao. Therefore, in this stage both cold and heat therapies should be considered. Because cold-heat symptoms are commonly seen in COVID-19 patients, the cold-heat therapy is better than other approaches.

It has been demonstrated that the incidence of abnormal liver function is 51.9% in COVID-19 patients who have received lopinavir/ritonavir combined arbidol antiviral treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed that antiviral agents and more concomitant medications are two independent risk factors of abnormal liver function. Therefore, monitoring of the adverse drug reactions should be strengthened; the unnecessary drug combinations should be reduced. The main adverse reactions of antiviral agents include:

(1) Lopinavir /ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat: diarrhea, nausea, vomit, the increase of serum aminotransferase, jaundice, dyslipidemia, the increase of lactic acid. Symptoms will recover after drug withdrawal.

{2) Arbidol: the increase of serum aminotransferase and jaundice. When combined with lopinavir, the incidence rate is even higher. The symptoms will recover after drug withdrawal. Sometimes a slowdown of the heart could be induced; thus it is necessary to avoid the combination of arbidol with β-receptor inhibitors such as metoprolol and propranolol. We suggest to stop taking the drugs when the heart rate drops below 60/min.

{3) Fapilavir: elevation of plasma uric acid, diarrhea, neutropenia, shock, fulminant hepatitis, acute kidney injury. The adverse reactions were commonly seen in elderly patients or patients complicated with cytokine storm.

(4) Chloroquine phosphate: dizziness, headache, nausea, vomit, diarrhea, different kinds of skin rash. The most severe adverse reaction is cardiac arrest. The main adverse reaction is the ocular toxicity. An electrocardiogram needs to be examined before taking the drug. The drug should be prohibited for patients with arrhythmia (e.g., conduction block), retinal disease, or hearing loss.

774,774,774,774,774,"1.2 Rehabilitation therapy

The rehabilitation therapy of severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients mainly includes position management, respiratory training, and physical therapy.

(1) Position management. Postural drainage may reduce the influence of sputum on the respiratory tract, which is especially important to improve the patient's V/Q. Patients must learn to tip themselves into a position which allows gravity to assist in draining excretion from lung lobes or lung segments. For patients using sedatives and suffering from consciousness disturbance, a standing-up bed or the bed head elevation (30°-45°-60°) may be applied if the patient's condition permits. Standing is the best body position for breathing in a resting state, which can effectively increase the patient's respiratory efficiency and maintain lung volume. As long as the patient feels good, let the patient take a standing position and gradually increase the time standing.

(2) Respiratory exercise. Exercise can fully expand the lungs, help the excretions from pulmonary alveoli and airway expel into the large airway so that sputum would not accumulate at the bottom of the lungs. It increases the vital capacity and enhances lung function. Deep-slow breathing and chest expansion breathing combined with shoulder expansion are the two major techniques of respiratory exercises.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Deep-slow breathing: while inhaling, the patient should try his/her best to move the diaphragm actively. The breathing should be as deep and slow as possible to avoid the reduction of respiratory efficiency caused by fast-shallow breathing. Compared with thoracic breathing, this kind of breathing needs less muscle strength but has better tidal volume and V/Q value, which can be used to adjust breathing when experiencing short of breath.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Chest expansion breathing combined with shoulder expansion: Increase pulmonary ventilation. When taking a deep-slow breath, one expands his/her chest and shoulders while inhaling; and moves back his/her chest and shoulders while exhaling. Due to the special pathological factors of viral pneumonia, suspending breathing for a long time should be avoided in order not to increase the burden of respiratory function, and the heart, as well as oxygen consumption. Meanwhile, avoid moving too fast. Adjust the respiratory rate at 12-15 times/min.

(3) Active cycle of breathing techniques. It can effectively remove bronchus excretion and improve lung function without exacerbation of hypoxemia and airflow obstruction.  It consists of three stages (breathing control, thoracic expansion and exhalation). How to form a cycle of breathing should be developed according to the patient's condition.

(4) Positive expiratory pressure trainer. The pulmonary interstitium of COVID-19 patients has been severely damaged. In mechanical ventilation, low pressure and low tidal volume are required to avoid damages to the pulmonary interstitium. Therefore, after the removal of mechanical ventilation, positive expiratory pressure trainer can be used to help the movement of excretions from the low volume lung segments to the high-volume segments, lowering the difficulty of expectoration. Expiratory positive pressure can be generated through air flow vibration, which vibrates the airway to achieve airway supporting. The excretions can then be removed as the high-speed expiratory flow moves the excretions.

(5) Physical therapy. This includes ultrashort wave, oscillators, external diaphragm pacemaker, electrical muscle stimulation, etc.

(1) Age: It is recommended that the recipients are not older than 70. Patients over 70 years old are subject to careful evaluation of other organ functions and postoperative recovery capability.

(2) The course of the disease: There is no direct correlation between the length of the disease course and the severity of the disease. However, for patients with short disease courses (fewer than 4-6 weeks), a full medical assessment is recommended to evaluate whether adequate medication, ventilator assistance, and ECMO support have been provided.

(3) Lung function status: Based on the parameters collected from lung CT, ventilator, and ECMO, it is necessary to evaluate whether there is any chance of recovery.

(4) Functional assessment of other major organs: a. Evaluation of the consciousness status of patients in critical condition using brain CT scan and electroencephalography is crucial, as most of them would have been sedated for an extended period; b. Cardiac assessments, including electrocardiogram and echocardiography that focus on right heart size, pulmonary artery pressure and left heart function, are highly recommended; c. The levels of serum creatinine and bilirubin should also be monitored; for patients with liver failure and renal failure, they should not be subjected to lung transplantation until the functions of the liver and kidney are recovered.

(5) The nucleic acid test of COVID-19: The patient should be tested negative for at least two consecutive nucleic acid tests with a time interval longer than 24 hours. Given the increased incidents of COVID-19 test result returning from negative to positive after treatment, it is recommended to revise the standard to three consecutive negative results. Ideally, negative results should be observed in all body fluid samples, including blood, sputum, nasopharynx, broncho-alveolar lavage, urine, and feces. Considering the difficulty in operation, however, at least the testing of sputum and broncho-alveolar lavage samples should be negative.

(6) Assessment of infection status: With the extended in-patient treatment, some COVID-19 patients may have multiple bacterial infections, and thus a full medical assessment is recommended to evaluate the situation of infection control, especially for multidrug-resistant bacterial infection. Moreover, post-procedure antibacterial treatment plans should be formed to estimate the risk of post-procedure infections.

(7) The preoperative medical assessment process for lung transplantation in COVID-19 patients: a treatment plan proposed by the ICU team → multidisciplinary discussion → comprehensive medical evaluation → analysis and treatment of relative contraindications → pre-habilitation before lung transplantation.

Strict discharge standards have been implemented in our hospital. There is no discharged case in our hospital whose sputum and stool samples are tested positive again in our follow-ups. However, there are some reported cases that patients are tested positive again, after being discharged based on the standards of national guidelines (negative results from at least 2 consecutive throat swabs collected at an interval of 24 hours; body temperature remaining normal for 3 days, symptoms significantly improved; obvious absorption of inflammation on lung images). It is mainly due to sample collection errors and false negative testing results. For these patients, the following strategies are recommended:

(1) Isolation according to the standards for C0VID-19 patients.

(2) Continuing to provide antiviral treatment which has been proved to be effective during prior hospitalization.

(3) Discharge only when improvement is observed on lung imaging and the sputum and stool are tested negative for 3 consecutive times (with an interval of 24 hours).

1. Assessing

Provide detailed information of the HFNC oxygen therapy to get the patient's cooperation before implementation. Use low dose sedative with close monitoring if necessary. Choose a proper nasal catheter based on the diameter of the patient's nasal cavity. Adjust the head strap tightness and use decompression plaster to prevent device-related pressure injuries on the facial skin. Maintain the water level in the humidifier chamber. Titrate the flow rate, the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂), and the water temperature based on the patient's respiratory demands and tolerance.

2. Monitoring Report to the attending physician to seek medical decision of replacing HFNC by mechanical ventilation if any of the followings occur: hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress evidenced by obvious contraction of accessory muscles, hypoxemia persists despite oxygen therapy, deterioration of consciousness, the respiratory rate > 40 breaths per minute continuously, significant amount of sputum.

3. Treatment of Secretions Patients' drool, snot, and sputum should be wiped with tissue paper, be disposed in a sealed container with chlorine-containing disinfectant (2500 mg/L).

1. Intubation Procedures

The number of the medical staff should be limited to the minimum number that can ensure the patient's safety. Wear powered air-purifying respirator as PPE. Before intubation, perform administration of sufficient analgesia and sedative, and use muscle relaxant if necessary. Closely monitor the hemodynamic response during intubation. Reduce movement of staff in the ward, continuous purify and disinfect the room with plasma air purification technology for 30 min after completion of intubation.

2. Analgesia, Sedation and Delirium Management

Determine the target pain management goal every day. Assess pain with every 4 hours (Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool, CPOT), measure sedation with every 2 hours (RASS/8I55). Titrate the infusion rate of analgesics and sedatives to achieve pain management goals. For the known painful procedures, preemptive analgesia is administered. Perform CAM-ICU delirium screening in every shift to ensure an early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Apply centralization strategy for delirium prevention, including pain relief, sedation, communication, quality sleep, and early mobilization are used.

3. Prevention of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) The ventilator bundle is used to reduce VAP, which includes hand washing; raising the tilt angle of the patient's bed by 30-45° if no contradiction is presented; oral care every 4 to 6 hours by using a disposable oral mucus extractor; maintain endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff pressure at 30-35 cmH₂O every 4 hours; enteral nutrition support and monitor gastric residual volume every 4 hours; evaluating daily for ventilator removal; using washable tracheal tubes for continuous subglottic suctioning combined with 10 ml syringe suctioning every 1 to 2 hours, and adjusting the suctioning frequency according to the actual amount of secretions. Dispose retentate below the glottis: the syringe containing the subglottic secretions is immediately used to aspirate an appropriate amount of chlorine-containing disinfectant (2500 mg/L), then be re-capped and disposed of in a sharp container.

4. Sputum Suction

(1) Use a closed sputum suction system, including closed suction catheter and closed disposable collection bag, to reduce the formation of aerosol and droplets.

(2) Collection of sputum specimen: use a closed suction catheter and a matching collection bag to reduce exposure to droplets.

5. Disposal of Condensation from Ventilators

Use disposable ventilator tubing with dual-loop heating wire and automatic humidifier to reduce the formation of condensation. Two nurses should cooperate to dump the condensation promptly into a capped container with chlorine-containing disinfectant (2500 mg/L). The container can then be directly put in a washing machine, which can be heated up to 90 °C, for automatic cleaning and disinfection.

1. ECMO equipment should be managed by ECMO perfusionists and the following items should be checked and recorded every hour: Pump flow rate/rotation speed; blood flow; oxygen flow; oxygen concentration; ensuring that the temperature controller is flowing; temperature setting and actual temperature; preventing clots in circuit; no pressure to the cannulae and the circuit tubing is not kinked, or no ""shaking"" of ECMO tubes; patient's urine color with special attention to red or dark brown urine; pre & post membrane pressure as required by the doctor.

2. The following items during every shift should be monitored and recorded: Check the depth and fixation of cannula to ensure that the ECMO circuit interfaces are firm, the water level line of the temperature controller, the power supply of the machine and the connection of the oxygen, the cannula site for any bleeding and swelling; measure leg circumfer-ence and observe whether the lower limb on the operation side is swollen; observe lower limbs, such as dorsalis pedis artery pulse, skin temperature, color, etc.

3. Daily monitoring: Post membrane blood gas analysis.

4. Anticoagulation management: The basic goal of ECMO anticoagulation management is to achieve a moderate anticoagulation effect, which ensures that certain coagulation activity under the premise of avoiding excessive activation of coagulation. That is to maintain the balance among anticoagulation, coagulation and fibrinolysis. The patients should be injected with heparin sodium (25-50 IU/kg) at the time of intubation and maintained with heparin sodium (7.5-20 IU/kg/h) during the pump flow period. The dosage of heparin sodium should be adjusted according to APTT results which should be held between 40-60 seconds. During the anticoagulation period, the number of skin punctures should be reduced as less as possible. Operations should be taken gently. The status of bleeding should be observed carefully.

5. Implement the ""ultra-protective lung ventilation"" strategy to avoid or reduce the occurrence of ventilator-related lung injury. It is recommended that the initial tidal volume is< 6 ml/kg and the intensity of spontaneous breathing is retained (breathing frequency should be between 10-20 times/min).

6. Closely observe the vital signs of patients, maintain MAP between 60-65 mmHg, CVP < 8 mmHg, 5pO 2 > 90%, and monitor the status of urine volume and blood electrolytes.

7. Transfuse through the post membrane, avoiding infusion of fat emulsion and propofol.

8. According to the monitoring records, evaluate the ECMO oxygenator function during every shift.

Preparation for patient: establish effective vascular access. Generally, central vein catheterization is performed for CRRT, with the internal jugular vein preferred. A CRRT device can be integrated into the ECMO circuit if the two are applied at the same time. Prepare equipment, consumables, and ultrafiltration medication before CRRT.

2. In-treatment Care

(1) Vascular Access Care: Perform professional catheter care every 24 hours for patients with central venous catheterization to properly fix access to avoid distortion and compression. When CRRT is integrated into ECMO treatment, the sequence and the tightness of the catheter connection should be confirmed by two nurses. Both the outflow and the inflow CRRT lines are suggested to be connected behind the oxygenator.

(2) Closely monitor consciousness and the vital signs of patients; accurately calculate the fluid inflow and outflow. Closely observe blood clotting within the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, respond effectively to any alarms, and ensure that the machine is operating properly.  Assess the electrolyte and acid-base balance in the internal environment through blood gas analysis every 4 hours. The replacement liquid should be prepared freshly and labeled clearly under strict sterile conditions.

3. Postoperative Care

(1) Monitor blood routine, liver and kidney function and coagulation function.

(2) Wipe the CRRT machine every 24 hours if continuous treatment is applied. Consumables and wasted liquid should be disposed in accordance with hospital requirements to avoid nosocomial infection.

Timely recognition of any deterioration to adjust strategies of oxygen therapy or to take urgent response measures. Pay attention to ventilator associated lung injury (VALi} when under high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and high-pressure support. Closely monitor changes in airway pressure, tidal volume and respiratory rate.

2. Aspiration Prevention

(1) Gastric retention monitor: perform continuous post-pyloric feeding with a nutrition pump to reduce gastroesophageal reflux. Evaluate gastric motility and gastric retention with ultrasound if possible. Patient with normal gastric emptying are not recommended for routine assessment;

(2) Evaluate gastric retention every 4 hours. Re-infuse the aspirate if the gastric residual volume is< 1 oo ml; otherwise, report to the attending physician;

(3) Aspiration prevention during patient transportation: before transportation, stop nasal feeding, aspirate the gastric residues and connect the gastric tube to a negative pressure bag. During transportation, raise the patient's head up to 30°;

(4) Aspiration prevention during HFNC: Check the humidifier every 4 hours to avoid excessive or insufficient humidification. Remove any water accumulated in the tubing promptly to prevent cough and aspiration caused by the accidental entry of condensation into the airway. Keep the position of the nasal cannula higher than the machine and tubes.  Promptly remove condensation in the system.

3. Implement strategies to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infection and catheter-related urinary tract infection.

4. Prevent pressure-induced skin injuries, including device-related pressure-induced injuries, incontinence-associated dermatitis and medical adhesive-related skin injuries. Identify patients at a high risk with the Risk Assessment Scale and implement preventive strategies.

5. Assess all patients upon admission and when their clinical conditions change with the VTE risk assessment model to identify those who are at a high risk and implement preventive strategies. Monitor coagulation function, D-dimer levels and VTE-related clinical manifestations.

6. Assist eating for patients who are weak, short of breath or those with an obvious fluc-tuating oxygenation index. Intensify oxygenation index monitoring on these patients during meals. Provide enteral nutrition at early stages for those who are unable to eat by mouth. During each shift, adjust the enteral nutrition rate and quantity according to the tolerance of enteral nutrition.

Figure 1 (facing page). Viability of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 in Aerosols and on Various Surfaces. As shown in Panel A, the titer of aerosolized viable virus is expressed in 50% tissue-culture infectious dose (TCID₅₀) per liter of air. Viruses were applied to copper, cardboard, stainless steel, and plastic maintained at 21 to 23°C and 40% relative humidity over 7 days. The titer of viable virus is expressed as TCID₅₀ per milliliter of collection medium. All samples were quantified by end-point titration on Vero E6 cells. Plots show the means and standard errors (I bars) across three replicates. As shown in Panel B, regression plots indicate the predicted decay of virus titer over time; the titer is plotted on a logarithmic scale. Points show measured titers and are slightly jittered (i.e., they show small rapid variations in the amplitude or timing of a waveform arising from fluctuations) along the time axis to avoid overplotting. Lines are random draws from the joint posterior distribution of the exponential decay rate (negative of the slope) and intercept (initial virus titer) to show the range of possible decay patterns for each experimental condition. There were 150 lines per panel, including 50 lines from each plotted replicate. As shown in Panel C, violin plots indicate posterior distribution for the half-life of viable virus based on the estimated exponential decay rates of the virus titer. The dots indicate the posterior median estimates, and the black lines indicate a 95% credible interval. Experimental conditions are ordered according to the posterior median half-life of SARS-CoV-2. The dashed lines indicate the limit of detection, which was 3.33×10^0.5 TCID₅₀ per liter of air for aerosols, 10^0.5 TCID₅₀ per milliliter of medium for plastic, steel, and cardboard, and 10^1.5 TCID₅₀ per milliliter of medium for copper.

851,851,851,851,851,"What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by individuals transporting patients who are confirmed with or under investigation for COVID-19 within a healthcare facility? For example, what PPE should be worn when transporting a patient to radiology for imaging that cannot be performed in the patient room?
In general, transport and movement of the patient outside of  their room should be limited to medically essential purposes. If being transported outside of the room, such as to radiology, healthcare personnel (HCP) in the receiving area should be notified in advance of transporting the patient. For transport, the patient should wear a facemask to contain secretions and be covered with a clean sheet.
If transport personnel must prepare the patient for transport (e.g., transfer them to the wheelchair or gurney), transport personnel should wear all recommended PPE (gloves, a gown, respiratory protection that is at least as protective as a fit-tested NIOSH-certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirator or facemask—if a respirator is not available—and eye protection [i.e., goggles or disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face]). This recommendation is needed because these interactions typically involve close, often face-to-face, contact with the patient in an enclosed space (e.g., patient room). Once the patient has been transferred to the wheelchair or gurney (and prior to exiting the room), transporters should remove their gown, gloves, and eye protection and perform hand hygiene.
If the patient is wearing a facemask, no recommendation for PPE is made typically for HCP transporting patients with a respiratory infection from the patient’s room to the destination. However, given current limitations in knowledge regarding COVID-19 and following the currently cautious approach for risk stratification and monitoring of healthcare personnel caring for patients with COVID-19, use of a facemask by the transporter is recommended for anything more than brief encounters with COVID-19 patients. Additional PPE should not be required unless there is an anticipated need to provide medical assistance during transport (e.g., helping the patient replace a dislodged facemask).
After arrival at their destination, receiving personnel (e.g., in radiology) and the transporter (if assisting with transfer) should perform hand hygiene and wear all recommended PPE. If still wearing their original respirator or facemask, the transporter should take care to avoid self-contamination when donning the remainder of the recommended PPE. This cautious approach will be refined and updated as more information becomes available and as response needs change in the United States.
Interim guidance for EMS personnel transporting patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 is available here. EMS personnel should wear all recommended PPE because they are providing direct medical care and in close contact with the patient for longer periods of time.

852,852,852,852,852,"What PPE should be worn by HCP providing care to asymptomatic patients with a history of exposure to COVID-19 who are being evaluated for a non-infectious complaint (e.g., hypertension or hyperglycemia)?
Standard Precautions should be followed when caring for any patient, regardless of suspected or confirmed COVID-19. If the patient is afebrile (temperature is less than 100.0oF) and otherwise without even mild symptoms* that might be consistent with COVID-19 (e.g., cough, sore throat, shortness of breath), then precautions specific to COVID-19 are not required. However, until the patient is determined to be without such symptoms, HCP should wear all recommended PPE for the patient encounter. If the primary evaluation confirms the patient is without symptoms, management and need for any Transmission-Based Precautions should be based with the condition for which they are being evaluated (e.g., patient colonized with a drug-resistant organism), rather than potential exposure to COVID-19.
This public health response is an important opportunity to reinforce the importance of strict adherence to Standard Precautions during all patient encounters. Standard Precautions are based on the principles that all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions except sweat, nonintact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. The application of Standard Precautions is determined by the nature of the HCP-patient interaction and the extent of anticipated blood, body fluids, and pathogen exposure. For example, a facemask and eye protection should be worn during the care of any patient if splashes, sprays, or coughs could occur during the patient encounter. Similarly, gloves should be worn if contact with body fluids, mucous membranes, or nonintact skin are anticipated.
*Note: In addition to cough and shortness of breath, nonspecific symptoms such as sore throat, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea have been noted as initial symptoms in some cases of COVID-19. These symptoms can have several alternative explanations; however, failure to identify and implement proper precautions in a healthcare setting for persons infected with COVID-19 can contribute to widespread transmission in that facility due to the presence of susceptible patients and close interactions with healthcare personnel. For this reason, a lower temperature of 100.0oF and the inclusion of mild and non-specific symptoms should be used by healthcare settings evaluating these patients to increase the ability to detect even mild cases of COVID-19.

853,853,853,853,853,"What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be worn by environmental services (EVS) personnel who clean and disinfect rooms of hospitalized patients with COVID-19?
In general, only essential personnel should enter the room of patients with COVID-19. Healthcare facilities should consider assigning daily cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to nursing personnel who will already be in the room providing care to the patient. If this responsibility is assigned to EVS personnel, they should wear all recommended PPE when in the room. PPE should be removed upon leaving the room, immediately followed by performance of hand hygiene.
After discharge, terminal cleaning may be performed by EVS personnel. They should delay entry into the room until a sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles. We do not yet know how long SARS-CoV-2 remains infectious in the air. Regardless, EVS personnel should refrain from entering the vacated room until sufficient time has elapsed for enough air changes to remove potentially infectious particles (more information on clearance rates under differing ventilation conditions is available). After this time has elapsed, EVS personnel may enter the room and should wear a gown and gloves when performing terminal cleaning. A facemask and eye protection should be added if splashes or sprays during cleaning and disinfection activities are anticipated or otherwise required based on the selected cleaning products. Shoe covers are not recommended at this time for personnel caring for patients with COVID-19.

860,860,860,860,860,"Q: When is someone infectious?
A: The onset and duration of viral shedding and period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset, similar to infection with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been reported, but it is not yet known what role asymptomatic infection plays in transmission. Similarly, the role of pre-symptomatic transmission (infection detection during the incubation period prior to illness onset) is unknown. Existing literature regarding SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) suggest that the incubation period may range from 2–14 days.

A: Very limited data are available about detection of SARS-CoV-2 and infectious virus in clinical specimens. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected from upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from upper respiratory tract specimens and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in blood and stool specimens, but whether infectious virus is present in extrapulmonary specimens is currently unknown. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in extrapulmonary specimens is not yet known but may be several weeks or longer, which has been observed in cases of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection. While viable, infectious SARS-CoV has been isolated from respiratory, blood, urine, and stool specimens, in contrast – viable, infectious MERS-CoV has only been isolated from respiratory tract specimens. It is not yet known whether other non-respiratory body fluids from an infected person including vomit, urine, breast milk, or semen can contain viable, infectious SARS-CoV-2.

874,874,874,874,874,"Q: How is COVID-19 treated?
Not all patients with COVID-19 will require medical supportive care. Clinical management for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is focused on supportive care of complications, including advanced organ support for respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. Empiric testing and treatment for other viral or bacterial etiologies may be warranted.
Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended for viral pneumonia or ARDS and should be avoided unless they are indicated for another reason (e.g., COPD exacerbation, refractory septic shock following Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines).
There are currently no antiviral drugs licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat COVID-19. Some in-vitro or in-vivo studies suggest potential therapeutic activity of some agents against related coronaviruses, but there are no available data from observational studies or randomized controlled trials in humans to support recommending any investigational therapeutics for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at this time. Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug, was reported to have in-vitro activity against COVID-19. A small number of patients with COVID-19 have received intravenous remdesivir for compassionate use outside of a clinical trial setting. A randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivirexternal icon for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory disease has been implemented in China. A randomized open label trialexternal icon of combination lopinavir-ritonavir treatment has been also been conducted in patients with COVID-19 in China, but no results are available to date. trials of other potential therapeutics for COVID-19 are being planned. For information on specific clinical trials underway for treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection, see clinicaltrials.govexternal icon.

881,881,881,881,881,"Q: What do waste management companies need to know about wastewater and sewage coming from a healthcare facility or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or person under investigation (PUI)?
A: Waste generated in the care of PUIs or patients with confirmed COVID-19 does not present additional considerations for wastewater disinfection in the United States. Coronaviruses are susceptible to the same disinfection conditions in community and healthcare settings as other viruses, so current disinfection conditions in wastewater treatment facilities are expected to be sufficient. This includes conditions for practices such as oxidation with hypochlorite (i.e., chlorine bleach) and peracetic acid, as well as inactivation using UV irradiation.

882,882,882,882,882,"Q: Do wastewater and sewage workers need any additional protection when handling untreated waste from healthcare or community setting with either a known COVID-19 patient or PUI?
A: Wastewater workers should use standard practices including basic hygiene precautions and wear the recommended PPE as prescribed for their current work tasks when handling untreated waste. There is no evidence to suggest that employees of wastewater plants need any additional protections in relation to COVID-19.

883,883,883,883,883,"Q: Should medical waste or general waste from healthcare facilities treating PUIs and patients with confirmed COVID-19 be handled any differently or need any additional disinfection?
A: Medical waste (trash) coming from healthcare facilities treating COVID-2019 patients is no different than waste coming from facilities without COVID-19 patients. CDC’s guidance states that management of laundry, food service utensils, and medical waste should be performed in accordance with routine procedures. There is no evidence to suggest that facility waste needs any additional disinfection.

More guidance about environmental infection control is available in section 7 of CDC’s Interim Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 or Persons Under Investigation for COVID-19 in Healthcare Settings.

I’m practicing social distancing as much as possible and limiting interaction with others, however, I live in an apartment complex with communal laundry. I’ve held off as long as possible from using the space, but realize this can’t be avoided forever. What’s the best way to use a communal space while protecting myself from possible exposure?

A: Brian Sansoni
This is a tough one, for those living in urban areas or apartment buildings with shared spaces – social distancing can only be done so long without impacting other hygiene and cleaning aspects of your life such as laundry.

If you have not heard from your property management about how they are adjusting their cleaning routine for communal spaces, now is the time to be empowered to do so. You should also be kept informed if anyone in your building has been exposed to the virus so you can take extra precautions.

Take disinfecting wipes with you when entering a communal space and use them to wipe down surfaces that are frequently touched (doorknobs, washer and dryer doors and buttons). If disinfecting wipes are not available, use a disinfecting spray bottle with paper towels. As an extra precaution, wearing gloves could also be helpful. Just be sure not to touch your face, if you do.

As always, once you return from the communal laundry room – take the time to wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds.

We have purchased and are using way more cleaning products than normal to help keep our family safe and healthy. With my kids at home for the next couple of weeks, what are the best ways I can practice safe storage with these products?

A: Brian Sansoni
This is a great question. Every parent knows how curious children can be, and how quickly accidents can happen. With our children at home, and more cleaning products in the house than normal, now more than ever is it important to make sure we take the appropriate steps when using and storing cleaning products.

When storing your cleaning products and laundry detergents, have a designated place in your home where these can be stored up and out of sight and reach from young children. If you do not have cabinets, store these products on a shelf in a plastic bin out of sight. When you return home from the store, be sure to store these immediately. Have them bagged separately so that when you return home, they are your priority to put away.

While it might be “trendy” to store these products in clear, glass containers, be sure to store all cleaning products in their original containers. These are designed to be child resistant and the labels have key safety information, including ingredients, should an accident happen.

1029,1029,1029,1029,1029,"Q: Shortage Question
I can’t find disinfecting wipes, what’s the best way to clean surfaces when I need to go out?

A: Brian Sansoni
In the absence of disinfecting wipes, disinfecting spray works equally as well. For hard surfaces, pre-clean any surfaces prior to disinfecting to remove any excess dirt or grime. Once you use a disinfecting product, make sure you let the surface air dry as recommended on the product label. This is where some folks may not be allowing the product to properly disinfect. Depending on the product, you need to let the surface air dry anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes in order to let the germ or virus kill take effect. That’s why reading the label is so important.

1030,1030,1030,1030,1030,"Q: Homemade Hand Sanitizer
Due to the shortage of hand sanitizer available at stores, I've seen links about how to make your own hand sanitizer. Do they work as well as store bought?

A: Brian Sansoni
We strongly recommend against trying to make your own hand sanitizer at home.

First off, washing with soap and water is the most important action you can take to help prevent the spread of illness and disease. Any kind of soap fits the bill.

Second, hand sanitizers you buy in the stores often contain emollients that can help moisturize and soften the skin. Your homemade recipe could be too strong and potentially damage your skin.

Third, trying to play “Mr. Wizard” at home won’t guarantee that you’ll get the product formulation mix just right.

We’re concerned from a safety standpoint that trying to mix ethyl alcohol or other types of alcohol in some home-made concoction could lead to safety issues – especially if there are young children in the home. When you mix your own, you’re on your own. You don’t have a product label to refer to in case of an emergency.

Stick with washing your hands with soap and water. There are also hand cleansing wipes available if you’re not able to grab some hand sanitizer.

As I washed my hands for 20 seconds and dried my hands on my powder room hand towel, I wondered. This seems to be okay for me who just washed my hands and lives alone, but what about people who share a space? What should we do AFTER we wash our hands, especially when you can't find paper towels? And generally, while I would imagine folks in shared spaces need to be more stringent than someone living alone and not going out, are there general -- but different -- guidelines for tor those who live alone or with other?

A: Brian Sansoni
Given the spread of the virus, when living with other people who share common spaces, it’s important to not only frequently wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, but also disinfect surfaces.  The CDC guidance is to clean and disinfect as needed. In a home, priority items to clean and disinfect include things like doorknobs, light switches, faucet handles and cell phones. Particular attention should be given to surfaces in the kitchen and bathroom. Use different towels and clean them regularly.

If someone in the home is ill, clean and disinfect surfaces they’re in contact with. For dishes, cleaning with dish soap by hand or in a dishwasher will remove most germs. To fully disinfect, one option is to use bleach (following product label instructions). For clothes and sheets, put them in the washer with detergent and then be sure to fully dry on high heat afterward in the dryer. Wash hands after transferring clothes from the washer to the dryer. Another option here is also using bleach or “color-safe bleach.”

I'm considered an essential worker and still required to go into my office. What's the best way to disinfect and protect? Are there certain surfaces I should pay more attention to?

A: Brian Sansoni
If remote working is not an option for you, there are ways to keep yourself protected as you get to and from work and in the office.

If you take public transportation to get to or from work, keep your distance from others as much as possible – up to 6 feet, and avoid touching surfaces such as handrails, bus poles, etc. Take disinfecting wipes with you to wipe down surfaces that can’t be avoided such as doorknobs. Avoid touching your face, including your eyes, nose and mouth when taking public transportation. If you are able to, and the weather allows, try walking or biking to work.

The most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently, for at least 20 seconds each time. When you are in the office, wash them regularly. You can also use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, if hand washing is not possible. Cough or sneeze into a tissue and throw the tissue away after use to lessen the spread of germs.

Can I put paper towel in one of my empty wipes containers and add some sort of bleach solution? What should be the ratio? Without hand sanitizer available right now, we need to have something on hand in the car. Any ideas?

A: Brian Sansoni
According to the CDC, for disinfection, diluted household bleach solutions, alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol, and most common EPA-registered household disinfectants should be effective and can be used if appropriate for the surface. Before mixing, it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation, and be sure to check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.

Prepare a bleach solution by mixing:

5 tablespoons (⅓ cup) bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water

1041,1041,1041,1041,1041,"Q: Wasting best cleaning products?
We hardly go anywhere now. But I’m still cleaning my house like crazy. Am I wasting my best sanitizing and cleaning products (ones on CDC list) now? They’re so hard to come by that I worry I’m using them up too soon. And I’ve heard products like Seventh Generation disinfectants (thymol) are not good against this. Why are they in my cupboard?! How can I keep our house as clean as it needs to be without going into an anxiety spin over it? I find myself frozen.

A: Brian Sansoni
Targeted hygiene practices are what you want to focus on. You do not need to 'panic clean' around the clock. 

The EPA continues to update its list of products that meet the criteria for use against coronavirus germs and more are getting added. Any of these will work when used as directed on the product label. However, you don’t need to kill the virus to remove it from a surface. Soap and water works to remove it and more cleaning products are being restocked in stores across the country, so I wouldn’t worry about running out. Just keep doing what you’re doing and make sure to wash your hands and clean frequently-touched surfaces regularly.

Do you have any scientific information on that ? I keep reading that on plastic and stainless surfaces it lasts the longest. Truth?

A: Brian Sansoni
According to a preprint of a new study, the novel coronavirus could be detected up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel. However, practicing targeted hygiene practices including washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth is still the best defense against the spread of the virus. And disinfecting wipes can be used on stainless surfaces; put your plastic containers in the top rack of the dishwasher.

1043,1043,1043,1043,1043,"Q: Bar soap
Is it safe to use bar soap to wash hands

A: Brian Sansoni
 
Washing your hands with either liquid or bar soap for 20 seconds is effective. Some people may prefer the liquid soap because you’re otherwise sharing the bar soap with another person. While WebMD reports that some research has “found that bacteria can stay on bar soap that stays wet because it gets used frequently... [other] studies that have looked to see whether that’s a problem show that the bacteria don’t seem to transfer to the next user.” So the greater threat is not washing your hands thoroughly. Use whatever type of soap you prefer.

A: Brian Sansoni
The hydrogen peroxide you buy at the drugstore is usually a 3% concentration. You can use it as is or dilute it with water to 0.5% concentration to disinfect surfaces. Let it air dry for at least one minute before wiping. Always make sure to check the concentration of hydrogen peroxide on the product label before using.

Hi Brian, How frequently should I be disinfecting household surfaces?

A: Brian Sansoni
The CDC guidance is to clean and disinfect as needed, so frequency will depend on how often a surface is touched. In general, you should be disinfecting frequently-touched surfaces every few days and food preparation surfaces more frequently. If someone is ill in the house, you’ll need to be even more vigilant and the CDC has useful guidelines.

A friend told me disinfecting wipes are almost useless to use on surfaces as they only move viral germs around and do not actually rid the surface of those germs. Is this true? Does a spray work better?

A: Brian Sansoni
Yes, disinfecting wipes are effective in ridding surfaces of germs. When you are wiping down a surface with the disinfecting wipes, do not move in a circular motion. Be sure to wipe in straight line to ensure you are not spreading the germs further across a surface.

A: Brian Sansoni
This is a great question. Wash at the hottest temperature safe for the fabric (check the care label) and then be sure to dry thoroughly, washing your hands after handling soiled laundry (ideally also wearing gloves and washing hands after removing the gloves) and after moving laundry into the dryer.

Do you recommend cleaning goods from grocery stores before bringing those items into the house? If so, what is the recommended shopping hygiene practice?

A: Brian Sansoni
The most important thing is minimizing exposure at the grocery store by making sure to keep distance between shoppers, avoid touching frequently-touched surfaces if possible and washing hands or using hand sanitizer afterward. After putting away groceries, wash your hands, clean/disinfect the counter they were sitting on and put any reusable bags in the laundry. For the groceries themselves, if it has a hard surface you could wipe it down with a disinfectant wipe, but in general these will items will have less chance of exposure and isn’t as much of a concern.

Hi Brian, Would love information on products that are not only effective cleaners, but also safe to use around a newborn baby. Thank you!

A: Brian Sansoni
There are a number of disinfectant and cleaning products that can be effective against the novel coronavirus on hard, nonporous surfaces, in accordance with the EPA Viral Emerging Pathogen Policy. As a parent, especially of a newborn, the health and safety of your child is paramount which is why proper disinfecting practices is key.

Once you use a disinfecting product, make sure you let the surface air dry as recommended on the product label. This is where some folks may not be allowing the product to properly disinfect. Depending on the product, you need to let the surface air dry anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes in order to let the germ or virus kill take effect. That’s why reading the label is so important.

If you’re disinfecting toys or other surfaces your baby may be in contact with, you can rinse with water after they air dry.

1055,1055,1055,1055,1055,"Q: Washing hands
If I use soap and wash them thoroughly does the water have to be hot?

A: Brian Sansoni
The temperature of the water when you’re washing your hands is more a preference of comfort. When you wash your hands with soap and water, the soap molecules surround bacterias and viruses and rupture their membranes, making them useless. Water washes these ineffective bacterias and viruses down the drain. What’s most important is scrubbing with soap thoroughly for at least 20 seconds.

A: Brian Sansoni
No doubt paper products are in high demand. If you are out of paper towels, our first recommendation would be to shift to either a microfiber cloth or a washcloth that can be laundered after use.  As a last resort to take the place of paper towels for disinfecting would be sponges as they tend to stay moist and can be a breeding ground for bacteria.

1057,1057,1057,1057,1057,"Q: Alcohol based products such as Vodka and Everclear
Vodka and Everclear range from 40% to 75% alcohol. Are these effective since we can't find isopropyl alcohol?

A: Brian Sansoni
First off, please don't make your sanitizer with vodka! Even the manufacturer of Tito's Vodka urged their customers not to do that. 

Washing with soap and water is the most important action you can take to help prevent the spread of illness and disease. Any kind of soap fits the bill.

Second, hand sanitizers you buy in the stores often contain emollients that can help moisturize and soften the skin. Your homemade recipe could be too strong and potentially damage your skin.

Third, trying to play “Mr. Wizard” at home won’t guarantee that you’ll get the product formulation mix just right.

From a safety standpoint trying to mix types of alcohol in some home-made concoction could lead to safety issues – especially if there are young children in the home. When you mix your own, you’re on your own. You don’t have a product label to refer to in case of an emergency.

Stick with washing your hands with soap and water. There are also hand cleansing wipes available if you’re not able to grab some hand sanitizer.

A: Brian Sansoni
If you aren’t interacting with others and are self-isolated, you shouldn’t have to worry too much. Just do your regular cleaning and wash your hands at critical times (after using the bathroom, before eating, when taking out the trash, etc.).

If you’re going out into crowded spaces during the day, you may want to change out of your clothes and put them in your hamper when you come home, but you can wait to wash the clothes until you have a full load.

For some, this means organizing for a full workplace shut-down with paid leave, to stop the spread of the disease. For others, this means getting essential workers everything they need -- supplies, staffing levels, hazard pay -- to adequately respond to the virus. We are a group of union members and workplace organizers with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) who can help you start a petition, connect with other workers, approach management, and successfully organize during this moment of crisis. |

In the past 2 months, we have provided various services to people in the quarantined city, including: Information services to COVID-19 as well as non-COVID-19 patients, quarantined communities, etc. Medical counselling, information and transport support to an oxygenator project; Comprehensive support to around 1000 pregnant women and new mothers in Wuhan by doctors in relevant disciplines, social workers and frontline voluntary drivers. It is heart-breaking to see anyone die from the virus, as we are all one. We would like to share our lessons based on the more than 1000 cases intervened and around 5000 cases documented.

This report provides a road map for navigating through the current COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. It outlines specific directions for adapting our public-health strategy as we limit the epidemic spread of COVID-19 and are able to transition to new tools and approaches to prevent further spread of the disease. We outline the steps that can be taken as epidemic transmission is brought under control in different regions. These steps can transition to tools and approaches that target those with infection rather than mitigation tactics that target entire populations in regions where transmission is widespread and not controlled. We suggest measurable milestones for identifying when we can make these transitions and start reopening America for businesses and families.

1) Better data to identify areas of spread and the rate of exposure and immunity in the population;
2)Improvements in state and local health care system capabilities, public-health infrastructure for early outbreak identification, case containment, and adequate medical supplies; and
3) Therapeutic, prophylactic, and preventive treatments and better-informed medical interventions that give us the tools to protect the most vulnerable people and help rescue those who may become very sick.

To strengthen our public-health surveillance system to account for the unprecedented spread of COVID-19, we need to harness the power of technology and drive additional resources to our state and local public-health departments, which are on the front lines of case identification and contact tracing. Finally, we must expand our investments in pharmaceutical research and development into COVID-19 and promote the rapid deployment of effective diagnostics, therapies, and eventually a vaccine.

The goal of Phase I is to save lives by:
1) Slowing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 across the United States by reducing the effective reproduction number of infections,
2)Increasing testing capacity to accommodate the ability to test everyone with symptoms and their close contacts, and
3) Ensuring the health care system has the capacity to safely treat both COVID-19 patients and others requiring care.

A successful Phase I will allow for a significant relaxation of physical distancing measures and a progression to Phase II, when more targeted, case-based interventions are possible.

1129,1129,1129,1129,1129,"Thresholds for Action

Trigger to Begin to “Slow the Spread.” The trigger to implement nationwide “slow the spread” measures2 in Phase I is the existence in multiple geographic locations around the country of confirmed cases that cannot be traced back to other known cases (“community spread”).3 This trigger has already been reached in the United States.

Trigger to Move to Phase II. To guard against the risk that large outbreaks or epidemic spread could reignite once we lift our initial efforts to “slow the spread,” the trigger for a move to Phase II should be when a state reports a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days (i.e., one incubation period); and local hospitals are safely able to treat all patients requiring hospitalization without resorting to crisis standards of care4; and the capacity exists in the state to test all people with COVID-19 symptoms, along with state capacity to conduct active monitoring of all confirmed cases and their contacts.5

| The trigger for issuing a recommendation to step down from a stay-at-home-advisory back to “slow the spread” is when the number of new cases reported in a state has declined steadily for 14 days (i.e., one incubation period) and the jurisdiction is able to test everyone seeking care for COVID-19 symptoms. |

Maintain Physical Distancing. Each state must maintain community-level physical distancing measures8 until the threshold for moving to Phase II is met. These Phase I measures include:

During the 2017–18 flu season (which was particularly severe), there were 18,000,000–27,000,000 medical visits for influenzalike illness spread out over approximately 32 weeks, averaging 562,000–844,000 visits per week. However, those visits were not evenly distributed throughout the season, and peak demand was higher, so we estimate a national capacity of approximately 750,000 would meet demand. South Korea has tested 1 in 170 people, cumulatively. To do the same, we would need to test 1.9 million people, which we could achieve in around 2.5 weeks with a capacity of 750,000/week.

CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies), especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.

CDC also advises the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.

Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.

1203,1203,1203,1203,1203,"Sewn Face Cover

Materials
• Two 10”x6” rectangles of cotton fabric
• Two 6” pieces of elastic (or rubber bands, string, cloth strips, or hair ties)
• Needle and thread (or bobby pin)
• Scissors
• Sewing machine

Tutorial

1. Cut out two 10-by-6-inch rectangles of cotton fabric. Use tightly woven cotton, such as quilting fabric or cotton sheets. T-shirt fabric will work in a pinch. Stack the two rectangles; you will sew the mask as if it was a single piece of fabric.

2. Fold over the long sides ¼ inch and hem. Then fold the double layer of fabric over ½ inch along the short sides and stitch down.

[file:///masks-cdc-2.png]

3. Run a 6-inch length of 1/8-inch wide elastic through the wider hem on each side of the mask. These will be the ear loops. Use a large needle or a bobby pin to thread it through. Tie the ends tight. Don’t have elastic? Use hair ties or elastic head bands. If you only have string, you can make the ties longer and tie the mask behind your head.

[file:///masks-cdc-3.png]

4. Gently pull on the elastic so that the knots are tucked inside the hem. Gather the sides of the mask on the elastic and adjust so the mask fits your face. Then securely stitch the elastic in place to keep it from slipping.
